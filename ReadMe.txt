How to run the code?

1) Install requirements.txt
2) To create a dataset for Friends and The Big Bang Theory run creation_dataset.ipynb, it will create a dataset for the embeddings + the PCA.
The code will take a .csv file, transform the sentences into embeddings. The output will be a pickle file.

3) For analysis:
Run TVSerie_v2.ipynb
The notebook follows this plan: 


* Analysis for The Big Bang Theory:
- Part1: PCA analysis
- Part2: logistic regression
- Part3: Heat map and graph

* Analysis for Friends:
- Part1: PCA analysis
- Part2: logistic regression
- Part3: Heat map and graph
