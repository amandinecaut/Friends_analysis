      "346\n",
      " You’re kidding, right?\n",

      " Yeah, I do like the one where Lois Lane falls from the helicopter and Superman swooshes down and catches her, which one was that? \n",

      " You realise that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy.\n",
      "349\n",
      " Yes, I know, men can’t fly.\n",
      "350\n",
      " Oh no, let’s assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling, accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second. Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Miss Lane, who is now travelling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces. \n",
      "351\n",
      " Unless, Superman matches her speed and decelerates. \n",
      "352\n",
      " In what space, sir, in what space? She’s two feet above the ground. Frankly, if he really loved her, he’d let her hit the pavement. It would be a more merciful death.\n",

      "354\n",
      " Are you listening to yourself, it is well established that Superman’s flight is a feat of strength, it is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings, an ability he derives from Earth’s yellow Sun.\n",
      "355\n",
      " Yeah, and you don’t have a problem with that, how does he fly at night.\n",
      "356\n",
      " Uh, a combination of the moon’s solar reflection and the energy storage capacity of Kryptonian skin cells.\n",

      " I’m just going to go wash up.\n",
      "358\n",
      " I have 26 hundred comic books in there, I challenge you to find a single reference to Kryptonian skin cells.\n",
      "359\n",
      " Challenge accepted. (Tries door.) We’re locked out.\n",

      " Also, the pretty girl left.\n",

      " Okay, her apartment’s on the fourth floor but the elevator’s broken so you’re going to have to (delivery man leaves) oh, you’re just going to be done, okay, cool, thanks. I guess we’ll just bring it up ourselves.\n",

      " I hardly think so. \n",
      "363\n",
      " Why not?\n",
      "364\n",
      " Well, we don’t have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable upper body strength.\n",
      "365\n",
      " We don’t need strength, we’re physicists. We are the intellectual descendents of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever and I can move the Earth, it’s just a matter… (starts to move package) I don’t have this… I don’t have this I don’t have this.\n",
      "366\n",

      "367\n",
      " Do you have any ideas?\n",

      " Yes, but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring.\n",
      "369\n",
      " Easy, easy (package falls) Okay! Now we’ve got an inclined plane. The force required to lift is reduced by the sine of the angle of the stairs, call it thirty degrees, so about half. \n",
      "370\n",

      "371\n",
      " What’s your formula for the corner.\n",

      "376\n",
      " Yeah, those are men who just had sex.\n",

      "384\n",
      " A little messy? The Mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy, this is chaos. Excuse me, explain to me an organisational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid.

      "398\n",

      " Do you realise that if Penny wakes up, there is no reasonable explanation as to why we’re here?\n",
      "420\n",

      " Emotionally.\n",

      " How?\n",
      "722\n",
      " Physics. (He places the glass over the olive and spins it until the olive gets caught up on the side).\n",

      " Wow, centrifugal force!\n",
      "724\n",
      " Actually, it’s centripetal force, which is an inward force generated by the glass acting on the olive. (The olive drops.) Excuse me.

      " Was this supposed to be a date?\n",

      "749\n",
      " Interesting.\n",

      "752\n",
      " It’s time travel, Leonard, I will have already done that. \n",
      "753\n",
      " Then I guess congratulations are in order.\n",
      "754\n",
      " No, congratulations will have been in order. You know, I’m not going to enjoy this party.\n",

      " How’s this? Pleased to meet you, Dr Gablehouser. How fortunate for you that the University has chosen to hire you, despite the fact that you’ve done no original research in 25 years, and instead have written a series of popular books that reduce the great concepts of science to a series of anecdotes, each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration of an average bowel movement.

      " It’s nothing personal, I’d just prefer if my future niece or nephew didn’t become flatulent every time they eat an Eskimo pie. \n",
      "3095\n",
      " I’m not happy, it’s the medication, I can’t stop smiling. (Waves hand at mouth. It keeps waving.)\n",
      "3096\n",
      " Now that Leonard’s made me aware of how high the genetic stakes are, we have to face the fact that none of you are suitable mates for my sister. \n",
      "3097\n",
      " Wait a minute. Leonard made you aware of that? \n",
      "3098\n",

      "3103\n",
      " Is it ‘cause I’m Jewish, ‘cause I’d kill my Rabbi with a porkchop to be with your sister.\n",
      "3104\n",
      " This has nothing to do with religion. This has to do with the fact that you’re a tiny, tiny man who still lives with his mother. \n",
      "3105\n",
      " Sheldon, you are really being unreasonable. \n",
      "3106\n",
      " Am I? Here. Eat this cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister. \n",

      " Truthfully, I’ve never given it any thought, but it has been pointed out to me that you carry DNA of great potential.\n",
      "3110\n",
      " Let me explain. You see, I’m a superior genetic mutation, an improvement on the existing mediocre stock. \n",
      "3111\n",
      " That would be you. But residing within you is the potential for another me. Perhaps even taller, smarter and less prone to freckling, a Sheldon 2.0 if you will. \n",
      "3112\n",
      " Exactly. Now, I am not saying that I should be the sole decider of who you mate with. If you’re not attracted to the suitor then the likelihood of conception would be reduced.\n",
      "3113\n",
      " Not at all. Frequent coitus dramatically increases the odds of fertiliziation. \n",
      "3114\n",
      " I always thought I was more like a cuckoo bird. You know, a superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds. Of course the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food, leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death. Luckily for you, that’s where the metaphor ended. \n",
      "3115\n",
      " I have an alternate proposal. \n",
      "3116\n",
      " You donate eggs. We will place them in cryogenic storage. I will find an appropriate sperm donor for your eggs, have them fertilized and implanted in you, that way everybody wins. \n",

      " Correction. Missy can date whoever she wants. \n",
      "3118\n",
      " Look, we have to settle this.\n",
      "3119\n",
      " I agree. Sheldon’s sister is hiding at Penny’s because we’ve all been hitting on her at the same time. \n",
      "3120\n",
      " She’s not hiding. She needed privacy to call her grandmother who’s apparently very sick. Oh, and then I believe she has to wash her hair. \n",
      "3121\n",
      " Oh, you poor, deluded bastard. \n",
      "3122\n",
      " Don’t start with me dude.\n",
      "3123\n",
      " You want to go again? Let’s go. \n",
      "3124\n",
      " Sit down.\n",
      "3125\n",
      " Okay. \n",
      "3126\n",
      " If we’re going to fight over Missy, let’s do it the right way. The honourable way.\n",
      "3127\n",
      " And he’s down!\n",
      "3128\n",

      " Excuse me while I go tell Missy the good news. (Leaves and knocks on Penny’s door.)\n",
      "3132\n",
      " Hi Penny, how’s it going. Listen, that guy Mike that you were dating, is that still going on?\n",
      "3133\n",
      " Uh, pretty much, why?\n",
      "3134\n",
      " Nothing, just catching up. By the way, may I speak to Missy please? \n",
      "3135\n",
      " Of course.\n",
      "3136\n",
      " Well, since you’re leaving tomorrow I was wondering if you’d like to go out to dinner with me?\n",
      "3137\n",
      " Oh. You have other plans, or…?\n",
      "3138\n",
      " Oh. Alright uh… enjoy the rest of your evening.\n",
      "3139\n",
      " What do you want, Howard?\n",
      "3140\n",
      " I’m fine, thanks for asking. I’ve come to call on Missy. \n",
      "3141\n",
      " Missy?\n",
      "3142\n",
      " The amazing Howard. Do you like magic?\n",
      "3143\n",
      " Then you are in for a treat. Behold, an ordinary cane. (Taps against doorpost. While humming he tries to perform a trick, but the cane falls in half with a yellow handkerchief flying out. Howard has to retrieve the pieces.) Da-dah! (Emerges with the handkerchief, on which are written the words “will you go out with me?”)\n",
      "3144\n",
      " Okay. (Does something with hands, from which another yellow handkerchief emerges. This one reads “are you sure?” Missy closes the door.)\n",
      "3145\n",
      " Missy?\n",
      "3146\n",
      " Thank you. I apprec…. (looks panicked) apprec…. appreeee…. oh-oh.\n",

      " Oh, honey, is your medication wearing off?  (Raj nods.)\n",
      "3148\n",
      " Well, she might be interested to know that I have refocused my research from bosonic string theory to heteronic string theory. \n",
      "3149\n",
      " Okay, well, it was pleasant seeing you, other than that business with my testicles. (Holds out hand to shake.)\n",
      "3150\n",
      " Really?\n",
      "3151\n",
      " You tell people I’m a rocket scientist?\n",
      "3152\n",
      " I’m a theoretical physicist.\n",
      "3153\n",
      " What’s the difference?\n",
      "3154\n",
      " My God! Why don’t you just tell them I’m a toll taker at the Golden Gate Bridge? Rocket scientist, how humiliating. \n",
      "3155\n",
      " Hey, guys, guys, some of the other waitresses wanted me to ask you something.\n",
      "3156\n",
      " Oh, it’s called trestling.\n",
      "3157\n",
      " It combines the physical strength of arm wrestling with the mental agility of tetris into the ultimate sport. \n",
      "3158\n",
      " Yeah, that’s terrific, but what they wanted me to ask you was to cut it the hell out. (To someone off) Right come on guys, come on. (Singing while approaching another table) Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you…\n",
      "3159\n",
      " We might as well stop, it’s a stalemate. You’re beating me in tetris, but you’ve got the upper body strength of a Keebler Elf.\n",
      "3160\n",
      " Keebler Elf? I’ve got your Keebler Elf right here. (Strains to push Sheldon’s arm down. Tries using both hands, still with no effect.) Okay, it’s a stalemate. \n",

      " So Leonard, will we be seeing you on Saturday for your free birthday cheesecake?\n",

      "3479\n",
      " Really?\n",
      "3480\n",
      " Yeah. Why not, I mean, what do I have to lose?\n",
      "3481\n",
      " Yeah. That’s the spirit. \n",
      "3482\n",

      "3483\n",
      " I’m sorry. Look, do you have a second.\n",
      "3484\n",
      " A second what? Pair of underwear? \n",
      "3485\n",
      " I was just wondering if I could talk to you? It’s about Leonard.\n",
      "3486\n",
      " Why me? Why not Koothrappali or Wolowitz?\n",
      "3487\n",
      " Well, Raj can’t talk to me unless he’s drunk, and Wolowitz is, you know, disgusting. \n",
      "3488\n",
      " Yes, I suppose he is. \n",
      "3489\n",
      " All I’m saying is, you know Leonard the best. \n",
      "3490\n",
      " Not necessarily. I’m often surprised by my lack of familiarity with Leonard. Just the other day I discovered, he not only has a loofah, he hides it. Why do you suppose a man would be ashamed of having a loofah? I myself prefer to have my excess epithelial cells slough off naturally, but I don’t condemn those who seek to accelerate the process.  (Time shift) And until recently I had no idea that despite his lactose intolerance, he can tolerate small amounts of non-fat ice cream without producing a noxious gas that I maintain in the right concentration could be weaponised. (Begins to unlock apartment door.)\n",
      "3491\n",
      " Leonard might come home, can we talk in my apartment. \n",
      "3492\n",
      " We’re not done? \n",
      "3493\n",
      " No.\n",
      "3494\n",
      " Ach, why not? We’re already through the looking glass anyway. \n",
      "3495\n",
      " Okay, so, here’s the thing. I guess you’re aware that Leonard asked me out. \n",
      "3496\n",
      " Well, he didn’t actually say anything, but when he came back to the apartment he was doing a dance that brought to mind the happy hippos in Fantasia. \n",
      "3497\n",
      " Oh, that’s nice. Anyhow, the thing I wanted to talk to you about is, you know, since Leonard and I have become friends, I was just… want to sit down? \n",
      "3498\n",
      " Oh, I wish it were that simple. You see, I don’t spend much time here and so I’ve never really chosen a place to sit. \n",
      "3499\n",
      " Well, choose.\n",
      "3500\n",
      " There are a number of options and, I’m really not familiar enough with the cushion densities, air flow patterns and dispersion of sunlight to make an informed choice.\n",
      "3501\n",
      " Alright, why don’t you just pick one at random, and then if you don’t like it you can sit somewhere else next time. \n",
      "3502\n",
      " No, no, that’s crazy. You go ahead and talk while I figure it out. \n",
      "3503\n",
      " Okay. Um, here’s the thing. So, I’ve known for a while now that Leonard has had a little crush on me…\n",
      "3504\n",
      " A little crush? Well I suppose so, in the same way Menelaus had a little crush on Helen of Troy. \n",
      "3505\n",
      " Alright, yeah, I don’t really know who they are…\n",
      "3506\n",
      " Well Menelaus was the brother of Agamemnon…\n",
      "3507\n",
      " Yeah, I don’t care, I don’t care. The point is Leonard isn’t the kind of guy I usually go out with.\n",
      "3508\n",
      " Leonard isn’t the kind of guy anyone usually goes out with. Would you be open to rotating the couch clockwise thirty degrees? \n",
      "3509\n",
      " No. What I’m saying is, Leonard might be different in a good way. Obviously my usual choices have not worked out so well. \n",
      "3510\n",
      " The last one worked out well for Koothrappali. He got a free iPod. Oh, glare! \n",
      "3511\n",
      " But on the other hand, if things don’t go well with Leonard, I risk losing a really good friend. I mean, I guess he’s not looking for a fling, he’s the kind of guy that gets into a relationship for, I don’t know, like you would say light years. \n",
      "3512\n",
      " I would not say that. No-one would say that, a light year is a unit of distance, not time. \n",
      "3513\n",
      " Thank you for the clarification. \n",
      "3514\n",
      " Draft. You see people hear the word year and they think duration. Foot pound has the same problem, that’s a unit of work, not of weight.\n",
      "3515\n",
      " Right, thanks.\n",
      "3516\n",
      " It’s a common mistake.\n",
      "3517\n",
      " Not the first one I’ve made today. \n",
      "3518\n",
      " Okay. I think this will be my seat. \n",
      "3519\n",
      " Sheldon, do you have anything to say that has anything to do with, you know, what I’m talking about. \n",
      "3520\n",
      " Well, let’s see. We might consider Schrodinger’s Cat. \n",
      "3521\n",
      " Schrodinger? Is that the woman in 2A?\n",
      "3522\n",
      " No. That’s Mrs Grossinger. And she doesn’t have a cat, she has a Mexican hairless, annoying little animal, yip yip yip yip…\n",
      "3523\n",
      " Sheldon! \n",
      "3524\n",
      " Sorry, you diverted me. Anyway, in 1935, Erwin Schrodinger, in an attempt to explain the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics, he proposed an experiment where a cat is placed in a box with a sealed vial of poison that will break open at a random time. Now, since no-one knows when or if the poison has been released, until the box is opened, the cat can be thought of as both alive and dead. \n"

      "3591\n",
      " You should thank us. When future generations try to determine why your relationship with Penny crashed and burned, this right here is the black box. \n",

      " What are you talking about, the date went fine. \n",
      "3593\n",
      " Dude, she said she wants to slow things down.\n",
      "3594\n",
      " Okay, so, she said she wants to slow things down. It’s like saying “I’m really enjoying this meal, I’m going to slow down and savour it.” \n",
      "3595\n",
      " No, it’s like “this fish tastes bad, so I’m going to slow down and spit it out.”\n",
      "3596\n",
      " You being the fish.\n",
      "3597\n",
      " I’m not the fish. \n",

      " Oh really, did you make a second date.\n",
      "3599\n",
      " Well, we sort of decided to wing it. \n",
      "3600\n",
      " Oh, even I know that’s lame. \n",
      "3601\n",
      " Okay, alright, let’s assume your hypothesis. We went to dinner, we talked, we laughed, we kissed, where could I have possibly gone wrong. \n",
      "3602\n",
      " Think back, Leonard, the littlest things can set women off. Like, hey, the waitress is hot, I bet we could get her to come home with us. Or, how much does your mom weigh, I want to know what I’m getting into.\n",
      "3603\n",
      " I didn’t say anything like that.\n",
      "3604\n",
      " Good, ‘cos they don’t work. \n",
      "3605\n",
      " They also don’t care for it if you stare at them and hyperventilate. Sadly, that’s my home run swing. \n",
      "3606\n",
      " Look, everything went fine. I didn’t even have to refer to my impromptu conversation starters. The woman across the hall is into me. \n",
      "3607\n",
      " Let’s go to the tape. Look at her reaction to the goodnight kiss, no change in respiration, pupils un-dilated, no flushing of the chest.\n",
      "3608\n",
      " Nice close up, by the way. \n",
      "3609\n",
      " Interesting, her jaws are clenched, no tongue access, clearly a bad sign amongst mating humans. \n",
      "3610\n",
      " That’s not a bad sign.\n",
      "3611\n",
      " Please, you might as well have been two iguana with no dewlap enlargement. \n",
      "3612\n",
      " And the worst sign of all is, you’re here and not there. \n",
      "3613\n",
      " I’m not there because I’m taking things slow. Which, by the way, compared to you guys approaches warp speed. And take down that camera. \n",
      "3614\n",
      " He was a lot more fun when he had no hope. \n",
      "3615\n",
      " Give him time.\n",
      "3616\n",
      " Oh, hi Penny. FYI, the hot water is inadequate on machine 2 so colours only, and 4 is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle so I’d avoid using that for your delicates. \n",
      "3617\n",
      " Oh, good Lord. Why don’t you just take your clothes down to the river and beat them with a rock? \n",
      "3618\n",
      " Sheldon, may I ask you a question? \n",
      "3619\n",
      " I would prefer that you not, but I won’t go so far as to forbid it. \n",
      "3620\n",
      " Alright, I heard yes, so… okay, here’s my question, has Leonard ever dated, you know, a regular girl. \n",
      "3621\n",
      " Well I assume you’re not referring to digestive regularity? Because I’ve come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate. \n",
      "3622\n",
      " No, I meant has he ever been involved with someone who wasn’t a braniac? \n",
      "3623\n",
      " Oh. Well, a few years ago he did go out with a woman who had a PhD in French Literature. \n",
      "3624\n",
      " How is that not a braniac? \n",
      "3625\n",
      " Well, for one thing, she was French. For another, it was literature. \n",
      "3626\n",
      " So, do you think that if Leonard and I keep dating he’ll eventually get bored with me. \n",
      "3627\n",
      " That depends.\n",
      "3628\n",
      " On what? \n",
      "3629\n",

      " Do you know any card tricks?\n",
      "3634\n",
      " Okay, okay, you know, I get it, Leonard has no business being involved with a waitress slash actress who felt so insecure that she lied to him about finishing community college. \n",
      "3635\n",
      " Why would you lie about that?\n",
      "3636\n",
      " Well, he was going on and on about this college and that grad school and I didn’t want him to think I was some stupid loser. \n",
      "3637\n",
      " You thought the opposite of stupid loser was community college graduate? \n",
      "3638\n",
      " You know, there are a lot of successful people in this country who are community college graduates. \n",
      "3639\n",
      " Yeah, but you were neither. \n",
      "3640\n",
      " Right, okay look, this is between you and me, you cannot tell Leonard any of this. \n",
      "3641\n",
      " You’re asking me to keep a secret?\n",
      "3642\n",
      " Yeah. \n",
      "3643\n",
      " Well I’m sorry, but you would have had to express that desire before revealing the secret, so that I could choose whether or not I wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping. You can’t impose a secret on an ex post facto basis. \n",
      "3644\n",
      " What? \n",
      "3645\n",
      " Secret keeping is a complicated endeavour. One has to be concerned not only about what one says, but about facial expression, autonomic reflexes, when I try to deceive, I myself have more nervous tics than a lyme disease research facility. (Long pause.) It’s a joke. It relies on the hominymic relationship between tick the blood-sucking arachnid, and tic the involuntary muscular contraction. I made it up myself. \n",
      "3646\n",

Now, you could say Mercury. That would give me a Y. Ooh.  Very clever, that’s a tough one. So I go Ytterbium, which gets you back to M. So you go Molybdenum, and I say Magnesium, you say Manganese, and  I say Europium, and, and you’re left with Mendelevium, and  there are no more M’s because I believe that Meitnerium should still be called Ekairidium, so congratulations, you win.

      " I need you and Raj to help me get the Rover out of the ditch, and I need you to get Stephanie out before somebody notices she’s here. She doesn’t exactly have clearance.\n",
      "5061\n",
      " Really? They don’t let strange women from honky-tonks come in and play with $200million government projects on distant planets?\n",
      "5062\n",
      " Yes, I was bad. Maybe she’ll spank me. Can we please move on?\n",
      "5063\n",
      " Yeah. No. I’m sorry, but something’s come up. Kind of a Mars Rover, Mars Rover, can Howard come over, situation. So my friend Leonard is gonna take you home.\n",
      "5064\n",
      " Okay.\n",
      "5065\n",
      " I’ll call ya.\n",
      "5066\n",
      " No one’s a scientist like Howard.\n",
      "5067\n",
      " My mother is so gonna love her.\n",
      "5068\n",
      " Oh, how nice. Maybe they can carpool when they visit you in federal prison.\n",
      "5069\n",
      " Just said Howard’s a terrific guy. He’s got a great sense of humour, he loves his mother, a lot, some people say too much.\n",
      "5070\n",
      " Yeah, I am loyal. You know, if you look at the big picture. Just, out of curiosity, did he ever have a shot with you?\n",
      "5071\n",
      " Then why did you?\n",
      "5072\n",
      " Got it. So, can I see you again?\n",
      "5073\n",
      " Ooh. Cool.\n",
      "5074\n",
      " Anything?\n",
      "5075\n",
      " Actually, I was just checking my e-mail. But, uh, no, the Rover is not responding.\n",
      "5076\n",
      " I believe the appropriate metaphor here involves a river of excrement and a Native American water vessel without any means of propulsion.\n",
      "5077\n",
      " Hang on, there’s got to be other options.\n",
      "5078\n",
      " You could try calling Triple-A, but based on NASA’s latest timetable, they won’t get there for 35 years.\n",
      "5079\n",
      " Plus I understand you have to be standing next to the vehicle with your card when they arrive.\n",
      "5080\n",
      " Oh, snap.\n",
      "5081\n",
      " Snap what?\n",
      "5082\n",
      " OK, I guess we have to turn to Plan B.\n",
      "5083\n",
      " What’s Plan B?\n",
      "5084\n",
      " Erase all the hard drives, scrap the surveillance tapes, wipe our fingerprints off every surface and run.\n",
      "5085\n",
      " Why wasn’t that Plan A?\n",
      "5086\n",
      " Thank God for Plan B.\n",
      "5087\n",
      " Howard, didn’t you say you worked on the Mars Rover?\n",
      "5088\n",
      " No, you’re mistaken.\n",
      "5089\n",
      " Yeah, when we first met, you said that if I went out with you, I could drive a car on Mars.\n",
      "5090\n",
      " I don’t know what you’re talking about.\n",
      "5091\n",
      " Psst! Psst!\n",
      "5092\n",
      " Will you all excuse me? Leonard is subtly signalling that he’d like to talk to me in private.\n",
      "5093\n",
      " No. Yeah, I remember specifically. You started by asking if I was from Mars because my ass was out of this world.\n",
      "5094\n",
      " Well, that does sound like me, but no.\n",
      "5095\n",
      " Is there some problem?\n",
      "5096\n",
      " Yeah. Listen, I have to kinda sneak out for a while.\n",
      "5097\n",
      " All right, goodbye.\n",
      "5098\n",
      " No, wait! If anyone asks you where I went, you don’t know.\n",
      "5099\n",
      " Where are you going?\n",
      "5100\n",
      " I can’t tell you that.\n",
      "5101\n",
      " Who would ask me?\n",
      "5102\n",
      " I can’t tell you that, either.\n",
      "5103\n",
      " So you brought me in here to inform me that you can’t tell me where you’re going and you can’t tell me who might ask?\n",
      "5104\n",
      " Yeah, I really didn’t think this through.\n",
      "5105\n",
      " Leonard, a moment.\n",
      "5106\n",
      " What?\n",
      "5107\n",
      " If someone, and of course, we don’t know who this would be, does ask where you’ve gone, what should I say?\n",
      "5108\n",
      " I don’t know. Just tell them I went to the office.\n",
      "5109\n",
      " Are you going to the office?\n",
      "5110\n",
      " No.\n",
      "5111\n",
      " Then how can I say it convincingly?\n",
      "5112\n",
      " Just say, Leonard went to the office.\n",
      "5113\n",
      " All right. Leonard went to (exaggerated) the office.\n",
      "5114\n",
      " What is? No, not like that! Just, Leonard went to the office.\n",
      "5115\n",
      " This would have worked out a lot better if you’d just told me you were going the office.\n",
      "5116\n",
      " I’m going to the office.\n",
      "5117\n",
      " See? Why don’t I believe you?\n",
      "5118\n",
      " I’m going out for a while.\n",
      "5119\n",
      " Okay.\n",
      "5120\n",
      " Doesn’t anyone want to know where he’s going?\n",
      "5121\n",
      " Okay, where is he going?\n",
      "5122\n",
      " Leonard is going to (exaggerated) the office.\n",
      "5123\n",
      " So how was work today?\n",
      "5124\n",
      " I’m hoping that’s three different guys.\n",
      "5125\n",
      " Oh, you know, I’m a physicist, so, I thought about stuff.\n",
      "5126\n",
      " Well, I wrote some of it down.\n",
      "5127\n",
      " Uh, yeah.\n",
      "5128\n",
      " If I knew you were waiting, I would’ve swallowed that lasagna whole.\n",
      "5129\n",
      " I’ve had her brisket. Melts in your mouth.\n",
      "5130\n",
      " That’s a good idea. There’s a bed in there, and I’m very, very, very pro-bed.\n",
      "5131\n",
      " Don’t you think we should tell him you’re not interested?\n",

      "5172\n",
      " That’s just ridiculous. Why are you cooperating with him?\n",
      "5173\n",

      "5174\n",
      " Howard, come on, I didn’t plan on this. These things just happen. Usually not to me, but they do happen.\n",

      " Did someone just feel a cold breeze?\n",
      "5176\n",
      " I believe this is an extension of the death metaphor. The cold breeze is the so-called ectoplasmic issue of a disembodied soul passing by.\n",

      "5178\n",

      "5179\n",

      "5180\n",
      " Sheldon?\n",

      "5186\n",
      " So, anyway, Lisa, I just wanted to tell you again how much I enjoyed the other night, and again, I’m sorry for how it ended. But again, if you could let me know about Friday. My mother needs a head count so she can know how big a brisket to get.\n",
      "5187\n",

      "5193\n",
      " I’m sorry?\n",
      "5194\n",
      " It’s colloquial, a conversation opener. So, do you find the weather satisfying? Are you currently sharing in the triumph of some local sports team?\n",

      " What’s wrong with you? you’re freaking me out.\n",
      "5196\n",

      "5197\n",
      " Please don’t do that.\n",
      "5198\n",
      " All right, But I’m given to understand that when you have something awkward to discuss with someone, it’s more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat.\n",
      "5199\n",
      " So, this wasn’t the awkward part?\n",
      "5200\n",
      " No.\n",
      "5201\n",
      " Oh, all right. S’u’up?\n",
      "5202\n",
      " Oh, good, I used that right. Anyway, you’re aware that Leonard has entered into a new romantic relationship which includes a sexual component?\n",
      "5203\n",
      " Okay, feeling the awkward now.\n",
      "5204\n",
      " Her name is Dr. Stephanie Barnett and she is a highly distinguished surgical resident at Freemont Memorial.\n",
      "5205\n",
      " Yeah, Leonard told me.\n",
      "5206\n",
      " Good. What he may have left out is how important this relationship is to me.\n",
      "5207\n",
      " To you?\n",
      "5208\n",
      " Yes, see, of the handful of women Leonard’s been involved with, she’s the only one I have ever found tolerable.\n",
      "5209\n",
      " Well, what about me?\n",
      "5210\n",
      " The statement stands for itself.\n",
      "5211\n",
      " Well, aren’t you sweet?\n",
      "5212\n",
      " Anyway, should you have any interaction with her, it would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival.\n",
      "5213\n",
      " Yeah, I think she’s pretty safe.\n",
      "5214\n",
      " You say that now, but consider the following scenario, you’re sitting in your apartment, it’s late, you’re alone, your hypothalamus is swimming in a soup of estrogen and progesterone and suddenly even Leonard seems like a viable sexual candidate, or a, uh, hookup as it’s referred to by today’s urban youth.\n",
      "5215\n",
      " Really?\n",
      "5216\n",
      " Yes. Now, should that happen, I would ask you to find some way to suppress your libido.\n",
      "5217\n",
      " I could think about you.\n",
      "5218\n",
      " Fine, whatever works.\n",
      "5219\n",
      " Always nice talking to you, Sheldon.\n",
      "5220\n",
      " Uh, peace out!\n",
      "5221\n",
      " Well, this is very pleasant.\n",
      "5222\n",
      " I’m glad you’re enjoying yourself.\n",
      "5223\n",
      " And you said there’d never be enough pasta for the three of us.\n",
      "5224\n",
      " I stand corrected.\n",
      "5225\n",
      " You know, Italian housewives have a rule of thumb. A handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter is sufficient for each person as it doubles in volume when cooked.\n",
      "5226\n",
      " Thank you.\n",
      "5227\n",
      " She doesn’t mean it. She’s just being nice.\n",
      "5228\n",
      " Well, Stephanie, since Leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball, I guess I’ll just have to pick it up. Have you ever witnessed a violent crime?\n",
      "5229\n",
      " Good. What’s your favourite fruit?\n",
      "5230\n",
      " Hmm, technically not a fruit, but all right. Where did you do your medical internship?\n",
      "5231\n",
      " Really? That’s where I was born!\n",
      "5232\n",
      " I spent so much of my childhood at that hospital. When I was 12, I got to ride there in a helicopter.\n",
      "5233\n",
      " Radiation burns. A little mishap while I was building my own cat scanner.\n",
      "5234\n",
      " No, I didn’t try, I succeeded. In fact, I was briefly able to see the inside of my sister’s guinea pig, Snowball, before he caught fire. It led to an interesting expression in our house, not a snowball’s chance in a cat scanner.\n",
      "5235\n",
      " Uh, Sheldon?\n",
      "5236\n",
      " Excuse me. When I come back, just for fun, the subject will be alternative history. Specifically, how would the civil war have gone differently if Lincoln had been a robot sent from the future? (To Leonard) Look at that, there’s even pasta left over.\n",
      "5237\n",
      " Do you understand that this was supposed to be a date?\n",
      "5238\n",
      " I do. Do you? Because frankly, you’ve been in a foul mood since I sat down.\n",
      "5239\n",
      " Okay, here’s my question, why did you sit down?\n",
      "5240\n",
      " To help. Look, if you fail at this relationship, and history suggests you will, then we risk losing the medical officer that our landing party has always needed.\n",
      "5241\n",
      " What landing party?\n",
      "5242\n",
      " You’re Kirk, I’m Spock, Wolowitz is Scotty, Koothrappali is the guy who always gets killed, and now we’ve got McCoy.\n",
      "5243\n",
      " Oh, my god, what did you do?\n",
      "5244\n",
      " Oo-oo-oh!\n",
      "5245\n",
      " Hi, Stephanie. I’m sorry I’m late, but your companion left the most indecipherable invitation.\n",
      "5246\n",
      " What invitation?\n",
      "5247\n",
      " We’re going to the movies. What movie? What theatre? What time? If you were trying to make it impossible to locate you, you couldn’t have done a better job.\n",
      "5248\n",
      " Oh, clearly I could have.\n",
      "5249\n",
      " It took me nearly 20 minutes to go through the browser history on your computer to see what movie times you looked up. Wait here, I’ll find us seats.\n",
      "5250\n",
      " Not the right seats. (Sheldon moves around the theatre sitting in various seats and shouting “Ha!”)\n",
      "5251\n",
      " He’s finding the acoustic sweet spot.\n",
      "5252\n",
      " Sometimes he brings a toy xylophone. I am really sorry about this.\n",
      "5253\n",
      " My apologies, you’ve been sitting in it all along. Leonard, you want to slide over one?\n",
      "5254\n",
      " No, just sit here.\n",
      "5255\n",
      " Oh, yeah, this is it.\n",
      "5256\n",
      " What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon?\n",
      "5257\n",
      " The blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial?\n",
      "5258\n",
      " This is Stephanie’s facebook page. Now, where it should say in a relationship, what does it say?\n",
      "5259\n",
      " Stephanie Barnett is single.\n",
      "5260\n",
      " Yeah, furthermore, earlier this evening, she threw a digital sheep at some guy named Mike. Who’s Mike? Why does he get a digital sheep and not you?\n",
      "5261\n",
      " It’s just her facebook page and we’ve only been going out a couple of weeks.\n",
      "5262\n",
      " You don’t see it, do you? We’re losing her.\n",
      "5263\n",
      " Okay, I’m going to make this very simple for you. You are not in this relationship, I am. Ergo, you have no say in anything that happens between me and Stephanie.\n",
      "5264\n",
      " I’m afraid I can’t allow that. Pursuant to Starfleet General Order 104 Section A, you are deemed unfit and I hereby relieve you of your command.\n",
      "5265\n",
      " General Order 104, Section A does not apply in this situation.\n",

      " Um, little bit. (She looks at her watch) What?\n",

      "5516\n",
      " What?\n",

      "5518\n",
      " Well, it’s a chance you have to take. I mean, look, if it’s meant to be, it’ll be.\n",
      "5519\n",
      " Very comforting. Okay, so what do I say to her?\n",
      "5520\n",
      " I don’t know. I mean, what have women said to you when they wanted to slow a relationship down?\n",
      "5521\n",
      " I really like you, but I want to see how things go with Mark?\n",
      "5522\n",
      " Yeah, that’ll slow it down.\n",
      "5523\n",
      " Oh, right, yeah, um, so, Stephanie, here’s the thing. I really like you.\n",
      "5524\n",
      " What speech?\n",
      "5525\n",
      " No! No, no! I wasn’t going to say any of that. I was just going to say, I really like you.\n",

      "5533\n",
      " You’re lucky. With me, it’s usually the other way around.\n",
      "5534\n",

      "5535\n",

      " How is it supposed to be a dance if I’m the only girl?\n",
      "5759\n",

      "5769\n",

      "5770\n",
      " Um, so what are you saying?\n",
      "5771\n",
      " I am saying it is not a compliment to call me doable. It’s not sexy to stare at my ass and say, “Ooh, it must be jelly ’cause jam don’t shake like that.” And most important, we are not dancing a tango, we’re not to’ing and fro’ing. Nothing is ever going to happen between us. Ever.\n",
      "5772\n",
      " Wait a minute. This isn’t flirting, you’re serious.\n",
      "5773\n",
      " Flirting? You think I’m flirting with you? I am not flirting with you, no woman is ever gonna flirt with you, you’re just gonna grow old and die alone.\n",

      " I hate to tell you, but the only warm memories I have of my childhood are of my Uncle Floyd.\n",
      "6363\n",
      " You’re clearly misremembering. Your mother is brilliant, analytical, insightful, and I’m betting she never hit you with a Bible because you wouldn’t eat your Brussels sprouts.\n",
      "6364\n",
      " Sheldon, you don’t give your mother enough credit. She’s warm, she’s loving, she doesn’t glue electrodes to your head to measure your brain waves while potty training.\n",

      "6372\n",
      " Why are you doing this?\n",
      "6373\n",
      " You know the rules. You brought your mom to work, you must suffer.\n",
      "6374\n",
      " Leonard, I had no idea your siblings were so much more successful than you.\n",
      "6375\n",
      " Yeah, you’re like the Jar Jar Binks of the Hofstadter family.\n",
      "6376\n",
      " Oh, meesa think yousa lookin’ so so sad.\n",
      "6377\n",
      " You know, rather than mock me, my friends might realize that this is difficult and try to help me through it.\n",
      "6378\n",
      " Nope, I think mocking you is more fun.\n",
      "6379\n",

      "6380\n",
      " That was fast.\n",

      " Say what? (Raj whispers in his ear) That’s basically what I just said.\n",
      "6386\n",

      " Her reasoning is unassailable. It is one o’clock.\n",
      "6389\n",

      " I was hesitant the first time I tried it, but I experienced an unanticipated and remarkable release of endorphins. It’s quite satisfying.\n",

      " Yeah, still funny, Raj.\n",
      "6468\n",
      " There’s no way we can get to the ridge. The Chemistry Department has us completely cut off.\n",
      "6469\n",

      "6470\n",
      " The Pharmacology Department controls that, and they’re all hopped up on experimental steroids.\n",
      "6471\n",

      "6472\n",
      " I think the time has come to acknowledge that we are paying the price for some of us failing to attend my Physics Department paintball strategy meeting.\n",

      " I told you my mom has spider veins, I had to take her to the laser clinic.\n",
      "6474\n",

      "6479\n",
      " No, that shouldn’t be a problem, Venus is up during the day. They’re probably just all staring at the sky.\n",
      "6480\n",
      " All right, what we need now is a tactical retreat. Did you see the episode of Stargate where they found themselves on a planet with a culture based loosely on Earth’s Athens and Sparta? Not important. Leonard, Raj and I are going to burst out the door and run away, Howard will cover us.\n",
      "6481\n",
      " Why don’t I run away and you cover me?\n",
      "6482\n",

      "6493\n",
      " Yeah, more cutbacks.\n",
      "6494\n",

      "6503\n",

      "6521\n",
      " Okay, one way to look at this is that I’m getting new equipment, and you’re not, and that’s unfair. But a better way to look at this is that I’m getting sex and you’re not, and that’s delightful.\n",
      "6522\n",
      " The whole thing froze. I don’t know what happened.\n",

      "7498\n",
      " That is the intoxicating aroma of Kadhai Paneer, a perfect culinary representation of the freedom this evening holds. Not only is it Indian cuisine, which Koothrappali loathes, it contains a generous helping of peanuts, which would reduce Wolowitz to a wheezing 97 pound blister. And finally, it’s main ingredient is Paneer, a farmer’s cheese which would cause Leonard to render any room uninhabitable within minutes.\n",

      "7831\n",
      " You actually had it right in the first place. Once again, you’ve fallen for one of my classic pranks. Bazinga! Well, now here’s a peculiar e-mail. The president of the university wants me to meet him at his office tomorrow morning at 8 a.m.\n",
      "7832\n",
      " Why?\n",
      "7833\n",

      " Yes, how did we live before Twitter? I guess you’ll find out what it is in the morning.\n",
      "7835\n",

      "7843\n",

      " Hardly a day goes by when I don’t think about it.\n",
      "7847\n",
      " Aw, how nice. Well, a space opened up at the last minute on the NSF expedition to the Arctic Circle.\n",
      "7848\n",
      " Wait a minute. He offered to send you to the North Pole?\n",
      "7849\n",
      " Yes. In fact, he was quite enthusiastic. He said, “Frankly, if I could send you tonight, I would.”\n",
      "7850\n",
      " Okay, well, do you want to go?\n",
      "7851\n",
      " Of course not. I’m a theoretical physicist, a career I chose in no small part because it’s indoors, but if I’m able to detect slow-moving magnetic monopoles there, I will be the scientist to confirm string theory. People will write books about me. Third-graders will create macaroni-art dioramas depicting scenes from my life.\n",

      "7857\n",

      "7858\n",
      " Well, then don’t go.\n",
      "7859\n",
      " How can you say that? The scientific opportunity of a lifetime presents itself and my best friend says don’t go.\n",
      "7860\n",

      "7863\n",

      "7864\n",
      " How was it resolved?\n",
      "7865\n",
      " It wasn’t. His wife set their dogs on me and rendered the question moot.\n",
      "7866\n",
      " Just imagine. If he says yes, we’ll have an entire summer without Sheldon.\n",
      "7867\n",

      "7868\n",

      "7882\n",
      " Really?\n",
      "7883\n",
      " Well, there are others who might be more qualified, but the thought of interviewing them gave me a stomach ache. Now, I know I’m proposing an enormous undertaking, so why don’t you take a few moments to discuss it?\n",

      "7998\n",
      " Yes, obviously.\n",
      "7999\n",
      " All right. Well, given that missing you is predicated on you leaving, logic dictates you must leave.\n",
      "8000\n",

      "8130\n",
      " Look, Sheldon, I just don’t think that the guys and Leonard really meant to hurt you. You know? They just told an unfortunate lie to deal with a difficult situation. Okay, you know what it’s like? Remember that scene in the new Star Trek movie when Kirk has to take over the ship, so he tells Spock all that stuff he knew wasn’t true, like saying Spock didn’t care his mom died?\n",

      " I don’t know, empathy? Anyway, I’m just saying that you’re feeling upset about something with Howard, and I’m upset about something with Leonard.\n",
      "8395\n",
      " Yes, yes, the disappointing sex. That’s an inexact parallel. You and Leonard can always return to being friends, whereas I can never return to a state in which Wolowitz has not bested me like Mrs. Riley’s chicken.\n",
      "8396\n",
      " What’s Mrs. Riley’s chicken?\n",
      "8397\n",
      " A chicken that was owned by Mrs. Riley.\n",

      "8402\n",
      " No, I mean, we can always go back to being friends.\n",
      "8403\n",

      " Hey. What’s going on?\n",
      "8406\n",
      " Oh, you’d like to catch up on the events of the day. All right. Well, there was a half-hour wait at the bank to get into my safe deposit box, I was forced to talk to Penny about your sexual problems, and, oh, yes, in a moment filled with biblical resonance, pride wenteth before my fall, causing my Flash 123 to goeth to Wolowitz.\n",
      "8407\n",
      " Wait a minute. You talked to Penny about our sex life?\n",
      "8408\n",
      " Leonard, it astonishes me how you continually fixate on the trivial. I lost a bet to Wolowitz.\n",
      "8409\n",
      " Right, right. You’re saying you talked to Penny?\n",
      "8410\n",
      "  Yes.\n",
      "8411\n",
      " Interesting.\n",
      "8412\n",
      " Hardly.\n",

      " Excuse me.\n",
      "8414\n",

      " Hmm. Oh, who cares?\n",
      "8417\n",
      " Oh, hey.\n",
      "8418\n",
      " Hey. Uh, what did Sheldon say to you?\n",
      "8419\n",
      " Not a lot. Just that we always have the option of going back to being friends.\n",
      "8420\n",
      " Is that what you want?\n",
      "8421\n",
      " I don’t know. I mean, you have to admit things seemed simpler when we were just friends.\n",
      "8422\n",
      " I guess.\n",
      "8423\n",
      " It would take the pressure off.\n",
      "8424\n",
      " It would, wouldn’t it?\n",
      "8425\n",
      " So, we’ll just be friends.\n",
      "8426\n",
      " Good, good.\n",
      "8427\n",
      " Come here. (She gives him a hug. It turns into a big kiss.)\n",
      "8428\n",

      "8429\n",
      " No.\n",
      "8430\n",
      " Why not?\n",
      "8431\n",
      " Penny, while I subscribe to the many worlds theory which posits the existence of an infinite number of Sheldons in an infinite number of universes, I assure you that in none of them am I dancing.\n",
      "8432\n",
      " Are you fun in any of them?\n",
      "8433\n",
      " The math would suggest that in a few I’m a clown made of candy. But I don’t dance.\n",
      "8434\n",
      " All right, want some French toast?\n",
      "8435\n",
      " It’s Oatmeal Day.\n",
      "8436\n",
      " Tell you what, next French Toast Day, I will make you oatmeal.\n",
      "8437\n",
      " Dear Lord, are you still going to be here on French Toast Day?\n",
      "8438\n",
      " Morning.\n",
      "8439\n",
      " Look, Leonard, Penny made French toast.\n",
      "8440\n",
      " Sorry. I haven’t given her your schedule yet.\n",
      "8441\n",
      " It’s an iCal download, she can put it right in her phone. And I thought we agreed that you’d have your conjugal visits in her apartment.\n",
      "8442\n",
      " We did, but there were extenuating circumstances.\n",
      "8443\n",
      " I see. Did her abysmal housekeeping skills finally trump her perkiness?\n",
      "8444\n",
      " No, her bed kind of… broke.\n",
      "8445\n",
      " That doesn’t seem likely. Her bed’s of sturdy construction. Even the addition\n",
      "8446\n",
      " A homunculus?\n",
      "8447\n",
      " Perfectly formed miniature human being.\n",
      "8448\n",
      " Oh, you’re my little homunculus.\n",
      "8449\n",
      " Don’t do that.\n",
      "8450\n",
      " Sorry. Okay, who wants syrup and who wants cinnamon sugar?\n",
      "8451\n",
      " I want oatmeal.\n",
      "8452\n",
      " Yes, well, I want a boyfriend whose roommate isn’t a giant pain in the ass.\n",
      "8453\n",
      " I’m sure that will happen soon enough. But in the meantime, I still want oatmeal.\n",
      "8454\n",
      " You know what, I give up. He’s impossible.\n",
      "8455\n",
      " I can’t be impossible. I exist. I believe what you meant to say is, “I give up, he’s improbable.”\n",
      "8456\n",
      " Sheldon, you really need to find a better way of dealing with Penny.\n",
      "8457\n",
      " What am I supposed to do, eat French toast on a Monday? Now, that would be impossible.\n",
      "8458\n",

      "8459\n",
      " You can catch even more flies with manure. What’s your point?\n",
      "8460\n",

      "8462\n",
      " Okay, so Kim the night manager went on maternity leave, and her husband’s name is Sandy, right? So get this, her replacement is a woman named Sandy whose husband’s name is Kim.\n",
      "8463\n",
      " Wow!\n",
      "8464\n",
      " I know. What are the odds?\n",
      "8465\n",
      " Easily calculable, we begin by identifying the set of married couples with unisex names. We then eliminate those unqualified for restaurant work, the aged, the imprisoned and the limbless, for example. Next we look at…\n",
      "8466\n",
      " Sheldon! it’s an amazing coincidence, can we leave it at that?\n",
      "8467\n",
      " I’m sorry. Ooh, Penny, it’s as if the Cheesecake Factory is run by witches.\n",
      "8468\n",
      " Ooh, Sheldon, it’s as if you don’t think I’ll punch you.\n",
      "8469\n",
      " Come on, you guys, let it go.\n",
      "8470\n",
      " Fine, whatever. Are you finished?\n",
      "8471\n",
      " Well, thank you. How thoughtful. Would you like a chocolate\n",
      "8472\n",
      " Um, yeah, sure, thanks.\n",
      "8473\n",
      " What was that?\n",
      "8474\n",
      " You said be nice to Penny. I believe offering chocolate to someone falls within the definition of nice.\n",
      "8475\n",
      " It does. But in my experience, you don’t.\n",

      "8482\n",
      " Howard, what did you do?\n",
      "8483\n",
      " They’re called tattoo sleeves. Look. I bought them online, Raj got a set, too. Fantastic, right? Put them on, have hot sex with some freaky girl with her business pierced, take them off, and I can still be buried in a Jewish cemetery.\n",
      "8484\n",
      " You know, I’ve always wanted to go to a goth nighclub.\n",
      "8485\n",

      "8488\n",

      " What?\n",
      "8503\n",

      "8599\n",
      " I was just thinking, we should probably turn in too.\n",
      "8600\n",
      " well, my new bed got delivered, if you come over and put it together, you can stay at my place.\n",
      "8601\n",
      " Really, that’s a lot of work, and it’s kind of late.\n",
      "8602\n",
      " Yeah, but if we stay there, we won’t have to be quiet.\n",
      "8603\n",
      " Let’s go.\n",
      "8604\n",
      " Interesting. Sex works even better than chocolate to modify behaviour. I wonder if anyone else has stumbled on to that.\n",
      "8605\n",
      " Okay, wait, how about this? We say there were four goth girls, the two girls in the club had two friends.\n",
      "8606\n",
      " I like it, I like it. Did they smell good despite their gothlike nature?\n",
      "8607\n",
      " What’s that got to do with the story?\n",
      "8608\n",
      " Engaging my olfactory sense helps make it real for me.\n",
      "8609\n",
      " Fine, they smelled good.\n",
      "8610\n",
      " Oh, they did. Like jasmine and honeysuckle.\n",
      "8611\n",
      " Whatever.\n",
      "8612\n",
      " And then they held hands and did a sexy, demonic hokey-pokey for us.\n",
      "8613\n",
      " No, no. Look, let me say my story all the way through, and then you can say yours, and then we’ll pick.\n",
      "8614\n",
      " I’m sorry. Go on.\n",
      "8615\n",
      " Okay. We got tattoos, and then the four girls took us to their place.\n",
      "8616\n",
      " But we don’t have tattoos. What if someone asks to see our tattoos?\n",
      "8617\n",
      " We say they’re in a very intimate area.\n",
      "8618\n",
      " Oh, we are bad boys, aren’t we?\n",
      "8619\n",
      " Right, right, so we go back to their place, and then the six of us end up in a hot tub.\n",
      "8620\n",
      " But we just got tattoos. Wouldn’t we be concerned about bacterial infection?\n",
      "8621\n",
      " True. Okay, forget the hot tub. The point is, we each have a ménage with sexy goth girls.\n",
      "8622\n",
      " Wow. What a great night.\n",
      "8623\n",
      " Yeah. Hey, want to try a country bar tomorrow night.\n",
      "8624\n",
      " Yeah, maybe we’ll get lucky with some sexy cowgirls.\n",
      "8625\n",
      " Could happen.\n",
      "8626\n",
      " I wonder how they smell.\n",
      "8627\n",
      " This movie baffles me every time we watch it.\n",
      "8628\n",
      " What do you mean?\n",
      "8629\n",
      " Well, the instructions are very clear, don’t feed the gremlins after midnight, don’t get the gremlins wet. How hard is that?\n",
      "8630\n",
      " Hey.\n",
      "8631\n",
      " Ooh, we’re honey now, are we?\n",
      "8632\n",
      " Yes. Since their relationship became carnal, Penny has upgraded his designated term of endearment, thus distinguishing him from those she calls sweetie, usually in an attempt to soften a thinly-veiled insult.\n",
      "8633\n",
      " You’re boring people sweetie.\n",
      "8634\n",
      " Although, sometimes, she omits the veil entirely.\n",
      "8635\n",
      " So, what are you guys doing?\n",
      "8636\n",
      " Celebrating Columbus Day.\n",
      "8637\n",
      " We’re watching Goonies, Gremlins and Young Sherlock Holmes. They were all written by Chris Columbus.\n",
      "8638\n",
      " Okay. What do you watch on Thanksgiving?\n",
      "8639\n",
      " The parade.\n",
      "8640\n",
      " Oh, you know, that reminds me, I usually go back to Nebraska for thanksgiving, but this year they’re calling it off on account of my brother’s trial.\n",
      "8641\n",
      " What’s he on trial for?\n",
      "8642\n",
      " Oh, just a big misunderstanding. You know, you’d actually like my brother, he’s kind of a chemist. Anyway, I was thinking I’d have thanksgiving here, and you are all invited.\n",
      "8643\n",
      " Oh. I’ll be there.\n",
      "8644\n",
      " Will you be serving cranberry jelly or cranberry sauce?\n",
      "8645\n",
      " I guess I could serve both.\n",
      "8646\n",
      " You guess? You don’t seem to have much of a handle on this.\n",
      "8647\n",
      " Yeah, I really wish I could, Penny, but every year my mother has all the relatives over and cooks up her famous tur-briska-fil.\n",
      "8648\n",
      " Tur-briska-fil?\n",
      "8649\n",
      " Turkey stuffed with a brisket stuffed with gefilte fish. It’s not as good as it sounds.\n",
      "8650\n",
      " Raj, what about you?\n",
      "8651\n",
      " Oh, he usually comes to my house. Right, pal? (Raj bursts into tears and runs away) All right, this year, you don’t have to eat the tur-briska-fil. I don’t even chew it. I swallow it like pills.\n",
      "8652\n",
      " So, what’s going on with Raj?\n",
      "8653\n",
      " Well, the good news is, he has no problem with my mother’s tur-brka-fil.\n",
      "8654\n",
      " Hard to believe, but go on.\n",
      "8655\n",
      " The bad news is, he says he’s getting deported.\n",
      "8656\n",
      " What do you mean, he’s getting deported?\n",
      "8657\n",
      " I believe it means that the U.S. Government is going to expel him from the country. He could then either return to his native India, emigrate to another country that’s willing to accept him, or wander the high seas as a stateless pirate. Personally, I’d choose pirate.\n",
      "8658\n",
      " Penny, would you mind stepping outside so we can speak to him?\n",
      "8659\n",
      " Ugh, fine. But the man really needs to work on his girl issues.\n",
      "8660\n",
      " Another reason to consider a life of piracy. Even today, I understand that’s an all-male profession.\n",
      "8661\n",
      " Okay, she’s gone.\n",

      "8743\n",

      " Well, usually, on Sundays, I go with Raj to scam on hippie chicks at the farmers market, but he’s still working with Sheldon, so I thought I’d come over here and make you guys scrambled eggs and salami. It’s the perfect meal for apres l’amour.\n",
      "8783\n",
      " Oh, kill me.\n",
      "8784\n",

      " Yeah, but it comes with a little coin purse. Does a Patang?\n",

      " I know, I know.\n",
      "9203\n",
      " And where were you?\n",
      "9204\n",
      " Getting shot down by the girl at Hot Dog on a Stick. But in my defence, she was gorgeous, and working that squeezer to make the lemonade, going up and down and up and down. It was like a free pole dance right in the middle of the food court.\n",

      "9208\n",

      "9209\n",
      " No, I’m mad at you. I hate myself, but I’m mad at you.\n",
      "9210\n",
      " Fine. You’re mad at me. I get it. Now, how about we go spend the day together? Just the two of us. We’ll go anywhere you want.\n",

      " I don’t know.\n",
      "9212\n",

      "9213\n",
      " I… I do enjoy the La Brea Tar Pits.\n",
      "9214\n",
      " Really, now? With the traffic and the parking, it’s… okay, fine. The Tar Pits. Let’s go.\n",
      "9215\n",
      " Oh, why can’t I stay mad at you?\n",
      "9216\n",
      " Go! Go! Go! Go-Go-Go-Go! Yes! Are you people watching this? Is this amazing or what?\n",
      "9217\n",
      " Sweetie, that’s a highlight from the ’98 championship game.\n",
      "9218\n",
      " Oh. Did not know that.\n",
      "9219\n",
      " How much beer have you had?\n",
      "9220\n",
      " None, why?\n",
      "9221\n",
      " Oh. I was just kind of hoping you were drunk. Now we’re back live.\n",
      "9222\n",
      " Okay, yeah. I can see the difference.\n",
      "9223\n",
      " That completely was a forward pass, which they threw intentionally incomplete to avoid loss of yardage or to conserve time. I can’t believe they’re not being penalized with the loss of a down and by having to move the line of scrimmage back to the spot of the foul.\n",

      "9230\n",
      " There’s some in the fridge.\n",
      "9231\n",
      " You shouldn’t keep your bread in the refrigerator. Staleness is caused by crystallization of the starch molecules, which occurs faster at cool temperatures.\n",

      "9234\n",
      " Mimesis?\n",
      "9235\n",
      " You know. Mimesis. An action in which the mimic takes on the properties of a specific object or organism. Mimesis.\n",
      "9236\n",
      " What the hell are you talking about?\n",
      "9237\n",
      " I’m attempting to communicate with you without my meaning becoming apparent to those around you. Let me try again. Have the indigenous fauna accepted you as one of their own? Nudge, nudge, wink, wink.\n",
      "9238\n",
      " Oh, I guess so.\n",
      "9239\n",
      " Good. Oh, FYI. After I eat my sandwich, I’m taking Koothrappali’s Patang kite out for a test run. Would you like to get your delta-wing raptor and join me?\n",
      "9240\n",
      " I don’t want to fly kites, Sheldon. We’re watching football here.\n",
      "9241\n",
      " I can see that. I was providing you with an alternative. A courtesy I was never offered in similar circumstances.\n",
      "9242\n",
      " Oh, look at that. The Oklahoma coach has thrown down a red flag indicating he’s challenging the ruling on the field. I hope he’s right, ’cause if he’s not, it’ll cost him one of his three time-Outs.\n",
      "9243\n",
      " You know, Leonard, honey, I wouldn’t mind if you wanted to go fly kites with Sheldon.\n",
      "9244\n",
      " No, I’ll watch the end of the game. Besides, there’s only three minutes left.\n",
      "9245\n",
      " Until half time.\n",
      "9246\n",
      " This is just half? We’ve been here for hours.\n",

      "9252\n",
      " I really like my saber-toothed cat. Thank you.\n",
      "9253\n",
      " My pleasure. Maybe after lunch, we can go to Marie Callender’s and have some pie.\n",
      "9254\n",
      " I’d like that. This is turning out to be a perfect Saturday.\n",
      "9255\n",
      " Good. I’m glad. Oh, man. Did you see the way she smiled at me?\n",
      "9256\n",
      " Fine. Go ahead.\n",
      "9257\n",
      " No. This is our day.\n",
      "9258\n",
      " If you want to chase after her, chase after her.\n",
      "9259\n",
      " Ah, who am I kidding? I wouldn’t have a shot with a girl like that.\n",
      "9260\n",
      " Don’t put yourself down. You’re a very attractive man.\n",
      "9261\n",
      " You think so?\n",
      "9262\n",
      " Yeah. Absolutely. It wouldn’t kill you to take a Pilates class with me now and then, but you have a certain wiry appeal.\n",
      "9263\n",
      " Yeah, well, it doesn’t matter ‘cause she wasn’t really smiling at me.\n",
      "9264\n",
      " Actually, in this case, I think she was.\n",
      "9265\n",
      " Really?\n",
      "9266\n",
      " Yeah.\n",
      "9267\n",
      " Bye.\n",
      "9268\n",
      " What a douche.\n",
      "9269\n",
      " Wow, Sheldon, I cannot believe you made up your own game.\n",
      "9270\n",
      " Oh, Research Lab is more than a game. It’s like the slogan says, the physics is theoretical, but the fun is real.\n",
      "9271\n",
      " We must not be playing it right.\n",
      "9272\n",
      " All right, five. One, two, three, four, five. Oh, wow, look at that, my Department of Defence research grant is renewed.\n",

      " Yay.\n",
      "9275\n",

      " Oh, gee, Sheldon, I don’t think we can play on Sunday.\n",
      "9277\n",
      " Why not?\n",
      "9278\n",
      " Because of the reasons that Penny will now tell you. Penny?\n",
      "9279\n",
      " Actually, I have to pick up my friend Justin from the airport.\n",
      "9280\n",
      " There you go, she has to pick up her friend Justin at the airport, aAnd I can’t play ’cause I’m going with her, right?\n",
      "9281\n",
      " Um, yeah, if you want. I mean, there may not be room. He’s got a lot of stuff, like guitars and amplifiers.\n",

      " Wait. What are you talking about?\n",
      "9283\n",
      " My friend, Justin.\n",

      "9286\n",
      " Your turn, Leonard.\n",

      " Come on, Leonard, if you roll a six, Penny dies horribly in a nuclear meltdown. See what I mean when I say the fun is real?\n",
      "9292\n",
      " Hang on. Some guy is going to be sleeping on your couch?\n",
      "9293\n",
      " He’s not some guy. He’s my friend.\n",
      "9294\n",

Their observed phase shift in the diffusing electrons inside the metal ring already conclusively demonstrated the electric analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum-interference effect. That’s it.

      " I don’t need anything at the Galleria. Do you need anything at the Galleria?\n",
      "10284\n",
      " No. We would just walk around and see what’s what.\n",
      "10285\n",

      "10286\n",
      " Okay, well, how about this? From the university Web site, 7pm to 10pm, Norton Hall Multipurpose Room, mixer for grad students and faculty of the science and humanities departments. Whether you split atoms or infinitives, this is the place to be.\n",

      "10565\n",
      " Oh, if that were only true. Unfortunately, as I’m earthbound for the foreseeable future, I need to find a location that’s more hospitable than the mean streets of Pasadena. Like Enid, Oklahoma. Low crime rate and high-speed Internet connectivity, but no model train shops. Sorry, Enid.\n",

      " Oh, come on. So you were the victim of a crime. That’s part of life. When my great-grandfather first came to this country, he put all his hopes and dreams into this little butcher shop he ran on the Lower East Side of New York. You know what happened? Every customer who walked into that butcher shop and asked for a pound of liver, got ripped off. But, those people moved on, and so should you.\n",

      "10581\n",
      " Thank you, fellow Bozite. And may I say, you are the living embodiment of all the promises made by our lovely town’s Chamber of Commerce. (Man picks up bags and starts running.) Wait! Wait! Excuse me! (At ticket desk) One ticket to Pasadena, California, please.\n",

      " Why else would a person try to engage their superior colliculus?\n",
      "10592\n",
      " Oh, sorry, sweetie, I can’t help you till I’ve had my coffee.\n",
      "10593\n",
      " Penny, I told you if you don’t put him in his crate at night he just runs around the apartment.\n",
      "10594\n",
      " What is he doing now?\n",
      "10595\n",
      " Mmm, he’s either isolating the terms of his formula and examining them individually, or looking for the alligator that swallowed his hand after Peter Pan cut it off.\n",
      "10596\n",
      " Captain Hook’s hand was eaten by a crocodile, not an alligator. If you’re going to mock me, at least get your facts straight.\n",
      "10597\n",
      " Aye, aye, Captain.\n",
      "10598\n",

      "10606\n",
      " No, I think it’s a firmware problem.\n",
      "10607\n",
      " Oh, that’s perfect. Bernadette’s been hocking me to take her roller skating.\n",
      "10608\n",

      "10609\n",
      " What could be better? We’re in.\n",
      "10610\n",
      " Great. It’s not like I brought it up because I wanted to go.\n",

      " Want my corn?\n",
      "10624\n",
      " Don’t be ridiculous. What would I do with corn?\n",
      "10625\n",
      " So roller skating, should we all grab a bite to eat first?\n",
      "10626\n",

      " Not this time, I promise.\n",
      "10629\n",
      " Okay, just to be clear, roller skating was my idea, and I’m very unhappy that you turned it into a double date, and I hope you both fall on your asses and break your coccyxes.\n",

      "10922\n",
      " That’s a somewhat ambiguous response. Am I going or not?\n",
      "10923\n",
      " Sheldon, at this point, I would go by myself before I would take you.\n",
      "10924\n",
      " Really?\n",
      "10925\n",
      " Yeah, really.\n",
      "10926\n",
      " Well then, you leave me no alternative. From this moment forward, we can be roommates, but we will no longer be friends.\n",
      "10927\n",
      " I’m sorry you feel that way.\n",
      "10928\n",

      " Just think, this time tomorrow we’ll be in Geneva, Switzerland for our first Valentine’s Day.\n",
      "10933\n",
      " I know! I went shopping today and bought special undies for the occasion.\n",
      "10934\n",

      " Oh!\n",

      " Did that sound okay to you? Do not come in here!\n",

      " What’s going on?\n",
      "10945\n",
      " I’m having a tea party. What do you think’s going on? I think I might have the flu. Or the plague.\n",

      " Well, our plane leaves at 9 a.m. Do you think you’ll feel better by then?\n",
      "10947\n",

      " Why don’t I pour it in your lap, and you can tell me.\n",
      "10957\n",
      " You don’t have to be mean. I’m sick.\n",
      "10958\n",
      " Yeah, well, I’m sick, too.\n",
      "10959\n",
      " Not my problem. I just don’t understand how this happened to me. I’m scrupulous about my hygiene. I regularly disinfect my hands, and I avoid contact with other people on general principle.\n",
      "10960\n",
      " I don’t know what to tell you, Sheldon.\n",
      "10961\n",
      " Happy Valentine’s Day.\n",
      "10962\n",
      " Oh, my goodness, look at this room! Champagne! Roses! Oh, and little chocolates! This is going to be the best Valentine’s Day ever.\n",
      "10963\n",
      " Yeah, I forgot about all this.\n",
      "10964\n",
      " But I never will.\n",
      "10965\n",
      " Will you please turn your shirt off?\n",
      "10966\n",
      " What? I’m giving myself dramatic entrance music. People will know I’m awesome and to be feared.\n",
      "10967\n",
      " Yeah, right, there’s nothing more awesome and frightening than a man who’s got music blasting from between his nipples.\n",
      "10968\n",
      " Hey, Stuart, what’s going on?\n",
      "10969\n",
      " Did he finally write a sequel to his autobiography? I’m sure ages 79 through 87 were just action-packed.\n",
      "10970\n",
      " Oh, I don’t want to know that! How can I possibly discuss with Stan Lee the scientific foundations for interstellar flight on a silver surfboard when part of my brain will be scanning his face for signs of contagious skin disease?\n",
      "10971\n",
      " Stan Lee does not have a contagious skin disease.\n",
      "10972\n",
      " Well, look who thinks he’s Stuart’s uncle now.\n",
      "10973\n",
      " Can’t believe it. We’re going to meet Stan Lee! (Presses play on his iPod. His shirt starts to play “I’m So Excited” by the Pointer Sisters. He dances.)\n",
      "10974\n",
      " I’m sad to say I taught him those moves.\n",
      "10975\n",
      " I can’t decide whether I want Stan Lee to autograph my Journey into Mystery 83, first appearance of Thor or my Fantastic Four number five, first appearance of Dr. Doom. (Raj presses his iPod. The theme from Jeopardy plays.) Alex, I’m going to go with what is… you’re a dumbass? (Presses again, his shirt blows a raspberry.)\n",
      "10976\n",
      " I’ve decided I’m going to have Mr. Lee sign my copy of this month’s Batman.\n",
      "10977\n",
      " That’s crazy. Stan Lee had nothing to do with Batman.\n",
      "10978\n",
      " Yes, which is why no one else will ask him to sign one, and I will be the possessor of a unique, albeit confusing, artifact, which will set me apart from the hoi polloi of comic book fandom.\n",
      "10979\n",
      " That’s a great idea, I’m going to get him to sign a Batman as well.\n",
      "10980\n",
      " What is it about the word unique you don’t understand?\n",
      "10981\n",
      " Ow! Damn, paper cut. Nothing worse than a paper cut.\n",
      "10982\n",
      " Well, obviously you don’t remember your circumcision.\n",
      "10983\n",
      " There’s Neosporin and Band-Aids in my top desk drawer.\n",
      "10984\n",
      " Why don’t you keep that stuff in the bathroom?\n",
      "10985\n",
      " He does. And in the kitchen. And in the car. And in his pocket.\n",
      "10986\n",
      " Yeah, but the ones in my pocket are mine.\n",
      "10987\n",
      " Hi!\n",

      " No, no, Stan Lee.\n",

      " Oh, oh, Stan Lee! Cool!\n",
      "10994\n",
      " You have no idea who he is, do you?\n",
      "10995\n",
      " Of course I do. You’re an important part of my life and I pay attention to the things you are interested in.\n",
      "10996\n",
      " Good, good, so, who’s Stan Lee?\n",
      "10997\n",
      " Um, he was on Star Trek.\n",
      "10998\n",
      " Nope.\n",
      "10999\n",
      " Star Wars?\n",
      "11000\n",
      " No.\n",
      "11001\n",
      " Um, uh, Stan Lee, oh, he was in those goofy kung fu movies you love so much?\n",
      "11002\n",
      " That’s Bruce Lee.\n",
      "11003\n",
      " Oh. So, is this Bruce Lee’s nerdy brother, Stan?\n",
      "11004\n",
      " Sheldon, why do you have all these unopened paychecks in your desk?\n",
      "11005\n",
      " Because most of the things I’m planning to buy haven’t been invented yet.\n",
      "11006\n",
      " But there must be thousands of dollars here. Why don’t you put it in the bank?\n",
      "11007\n",
      " I don’t trust banks. I believe that when the robots rise up, ATMs will lead the charge.\n",
      "11008\n",
      " You’ve also got something from the Pasadena Municipal Court.\n",
      "11009\n",
      " Undoubtedly yet another snide response to my repeated letters complaining that the flags in front of the courthouse are flying in the wrong order. From left to right, it’s supposed to be federal, state, and then city of Pasadena.\n",
      "11010\n",
      " I’m sorry. You sent more than one letter about that?\n",

      " November 16? Penny, that’s the evening you fell in your bathtub and I had to drive you to the emergency room.\n",

      "11023\n",
      " So you betrayed me?\n",
      "11024\n",
      " No! It wasn’t a betrayal. It was more of a can’t afford any more points on my license. I already have to buy my insurance from this place in the Cayman Islands.\n",

      " Excellent. Go on.\n",
      "11054\n",

      " And yet you wound up in traffic court. Anyway, if it would please the court, I’d like to begin with an opening statement.\n",
      "11063\n",
      " Very well, a quick opening statement. Like a milking stool, my case rests on three legs. I will demonstrate that I was improperly instructed in driving by a woman whose lack of respect for society borders on the sociopathic. I will argue that the emergency met the legal doctrine of quod est necessarium est licitum, that which is necessary is legal. But first, I will raise a Sixth Amendment issue. I’m unable to confront my accuser, a non-human entity, to wit, a camera. So, to sum up, improper instruction, quod est necessarium est licitum, Sixth Amendment. My milk stool is complete.\n",

      " Hold on. Sheldon, is there ketchup on that table?\n",
      "11186\n",
      " Yes, there is. Oh, here’s a fun fact, ketchup started out as a general term for sauce, typically made of, uh, mushrooms or fish brine with herbs and spices. Some popular early main ingredients included blueberry, anchovy, oyster, kidney bean and grape.\n",
      "11187\n",
      " No, that’s okay. I’ll get it.\n",
      "11188\n",
      " Listen, I was looking at the ring, and it seemed a little weird. No copyright notice on it. So, I took it down to this buddy of mine who deals with, shall we say, the seedy underbelly of the collectibles world.\n",

      "11201\n",
      " No, but it’s close. Look at the markings inside. Those are production markings. Nine rings were made for use in the Lord of the Rings movies. Three were given to members of the cast. The rest were destroyed. Except one. One was stolen. Gentlemen, this is the one ring.\n",
      "11202\n",
      " No, it is not yours. We all went in on the box together.\n",
      "11203\n",
      " Well, yes, but I found it in the box, and the laws of maritime salvage clearly state that the finder of a sunken treasure is the owner of the treasure.\n",
      "11204\n",
      " How is this maritime salvage?\n",
      "11205\n",

      "11208\n",
      " Your guy Eddie Crispo?\n",
      "11209\n",
      " Yes. He figures ten, maybe 15 thousand.\n",
      "11210\n",
      " Okay, that’s a lot of money. The wise thing to do is invest it in something practical. Like a jet ski.\n",

      "11214\n",
      " It’s sad how great that sounds.\n",
      "11215\n",
      " Guys, it’s stolen. It should go back to Peter Jackson. He made the movies, it belongs to him.\n",
      "11216\n",
      " Fine. He can have it back as long as he promises to make me a hobbit in his next movie.\n",

      " Don’t you eventually realize you’re just the same stressed out person in a cute top or a fun skirt?\n",
      "11433\n",
      " Yeah, that’s when I buy shoes. Now, let’s see what we’ve got. Ooh! This is nice.\n",

      "11447\n",
      " That’s how you start a psychotherapy session? How am I doing? I was promised a riverboat journey into the jungles of my subconscious. Instead, I get the same question I hear from the lady who slices my bologna at Ralph’s.\n",

      "11451\n",
      " I recently had a dream that I was a giant. But everything around me was to scale, so it all looked normal.\n",

      "11453\n",

      "11454\n",
      " Why don’t we just talk?\n",
      "11455\n",
      " Ah, the talking cure. Classical Freudian, good choice. If it will help speed things along, uh, my answers to the standard Rorschach ink blot test are A, a bat, B, a bat, C, a bat, and D, my father killing my mother with a hypodermic needle.\n",
      "11456\n",
      " Why don’t I just start? Sometimes people have trouble accepting accolades if, on a subconscious level, they don’t feel they deserve them. Do you think maybe that’s what’s happening here?\n",
      "11457\n",
      " Really, Leonard? You’re just going to try to recycle Adler’s doctrine of the inferiority complex? I could probably get that from the woman at Ralph’s. And she’d let me taste some pieces of cheese for free.\n",
      "11458\n",
      " But it could be part of your problem. Let me give you an example. When I was eight, I won a ribbon at the science fair for my project, “Do Lima Beans Grow Better to Classical Music.” But my mother pointed out that it was just a rehash of my brother’s earlier “Do Lima Beans Grow Worse to Rock ‘n’ Roll.” I felt so guilty, I gave the ribbon back.\n",
      "11459\n",
      " And how did that make you feel?\n",

My name is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, and it is my very great honour to introduce the winner of this year’s Chancellor’s award for Science and my good friend, Dr. Sheldon Cooper. But before I do, I’d like to share with you a letter from Sheldon’s mother, who couldn’t be here tonight. Isn’t that nice? His mother sent him a letter. She’s proud of him. I wonder what that feels like. Dear Shelly. That’s what she calls him. Shelly, it’s a pet name. You know what my mother’s pet name for me is? Leonard. But I digress. Dear Shelly. I am so proud of… (continues as background noise)\n",

      " Thanks, shorty,I’ll take it from here. All right, you people ready to have some fun? You have a basic understanding of differential calculus and at least one year of algebraic topology? Well, then here come the jokes. Why did the chicken cross the Mobius strip? To get to the same side, bazinga! All right, a neutron walks into a bar and asks, how much for a drink? The bartender says, for you, no charge. Hello? I know you’re out there. I can hear you metabolizing oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide. Looks like we have some academic dignitaries in the audience. Dr. Randall from the geology department, only man who’s happy when they take his work for granite. Ba-da cha! I kid the geologists, of course, but it’s only ’cause I have no respect for the field. Let’s get serious for a moment. Why are we all here? ‘Cause we’re scientists. And what do scientists study? The universe. And what’s the universe made of? I am so glad you asked. (Singing) There’s antimony, arsenic, aluminium, selenium, and hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen and rhenium, and nickel, neodymium,\n",

But if we had access to higher dimensions, we could move our pants around our bodies through the fourth dimension and our days of dropping trousers would be over.\n",

      "11521\n",
      " Big or small, I don’t like rabbits. They always look like they’re about to say something, but they never do.\n",
      "11522\n",
      " Rabbits do have a respiratory system that would support great size. And on a side note, they are one of the few mammals whose scrotum is in front of the penis.\n",
      "11523\n",

      "11524\n",

      "11525\n",
      " I honestly don’t care.\n",

      " Can we please talk about something else? Maybe something vaguely related to life as we know it on this planet?\n",
      "11531\n",
      " Okay, how about this for a topic, why is Leonard being a giant douche? Assuming giant douches are possible.\n",
      "11532\n",
      " Of course they are. Leonard’s being one.\n",
      "11533\n",
      " Maybe he’s having a lover’s spat with Penny.\n",
      "11534\n",
      " No, there was no spat.\n",
      "11535\n",

      " I’m just asking, dude. It happens.\n",
      "11542\n",
      " Oh, yes. In fact, I’ve prepared some trash talk for the occasion. You bowl like your mama. Unless, of course, she bowls well. In which case, you bowl nothing like her.\n",
      "11543\n",
      " That is what is referred to as a burn on you.\n",

      " I shall. Have a nice scoot.\n",

      "11811\n",

      " So, um, was Leonard okay with you coming over?\n",
      "11815\n",
      " Oh, yes. In fact, he said, I’m fine, I don’t care. And he in no way said it in a manner which would lead one to believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and betrayal.\n",

      "11826\n",
      " All right. So, what’s new in your life?\n",
      "11827\n",
      " Well, my new shoes are not made for running.\n",
      "11828\n",
      " Have you been running?\n",
      "11829\n",
      " No. It’s just a suspicion I have. Mmm, mmm, mmm.\n",
      "11830\n",

      "11831\n",

      "11833\n",

      "11898\n",

      "11901\n",
      " Okay, whatever.\n",
      "11902\n",
      " And don’t let him go on Space Mountain after he eats. He’ll say he can handle it, but I promise you’ll end up with churro puke on your shoes.\n",

      " When you say non-related female, you still mean human, right?\n",

      " Thank you. Why is a world-renowned scientist staying in our apartment instead of a hotel?\n",
      "11977\n",
      " Well, she doesn’t care for hotels. And who can blame her? Windows that don’t open, multi-user linens, keys shaped like credit cards, as if one walks around with unassigned slots in one’s wallet. All right, I believe I have time for one more question. Yes, Raj?\n",

      "12199\n",
      " This seat is ideally located both in relation to the heat source in the winter and a cross breeze in the summer.

As a result, I’ve placed it in a state of eternal dibs.\n",

      " Uh, I’m gonna go with preserving the knowledge.\n",
      "12217\n",

      " Okay, Sheldon, I think you’ve made your point.\n",
      "12794\n",
      " So we multiply 193, minus 21 men before the loss of virginity, so 172 times 0.18 gives us 30.96 sexual partners. Let’s round that up to 31.\n",
      "12795\n",
      " Okay, Sheldon, you are so wrong. That is not even close to the real number. I’m gonna need a drink over here.\n",

      "13351\n",

      "13356\n",
      " Okay. Well, you know World of Warcraft?\n",

      " Um, the online game? Sure.\n",
      "13358\n",
      " Well, did you know that the characters in the game can have sex with each other?\n",
      "13359\n",
      " Oh, God. I think I see where this is going.\n",
      "13360\n",
      " Her name was Glissinda the Troll. Bernadette walked in on me while we were doing the cyber-nasty under the Bridge of Souls.\n",
      "13361\n",
      " Oh, you’re right. That is so embarrassing.\n",
      "13362\n",

      "13363\n",
      " Bernadette or the troll?\n",
      "13364\n",

      "13365\n",
      " Well, what was your side?\n",
      "13366\n",
      " Well, for all we know, Glissinda the Troll wasn’t even a real woman. I mean, she could’ve been a 50-year-old truck driver in New Jersey.\n",
      "13367\n",
      " Really? And that didn’t make her feel better?\n",
      "13368\n",
      " Will you talk to her, see if there’s any chance at all we could get back together?\n",
      "13369\n",
      " Oh, gee, Howard, I really don’t want to get in the middle of this.\n",
      "13370\n",
      " No. Why would you? I’m just another lonely nerd, living with his mother, trying to find any scrap of happiness he can. You know, maybe to make up for the fact that his dad left him when he was 11.\n",
      "13371\n",
      " Okay, I will think about it.\n",

      "13488\n",
      " Well, we’ll just see how long you can hold out.\n",
      "13489\n",
      " Well, we’ll just see how your noxious gas fares against my cinnamon-apple-scented aroma therapy candles.\n",
      "13490\n",

      "13491\n",

      "13496\n",
      " That is apt and amusing. I think I shall share that with Amy Farrah Fowler. She’ll appreciate the witticism.\n",
      "13497\n",
      " Thank you.\n",
      "13498\n",

      "13500\n",
      " Well, the status is as it always was. She’s a girl. She’s a friend. She is not my, please forgive me for doing this, girlfriend.\n",
      "13501\n",

      "13502\n",
      " Leonard, you are my best friend. I’ve known you for seven years, and I can barely tolerate sitting on the couch with you. Imagine my attitude regarding prolonged physical proximity to Amy Farrah Fowler.\n",

      "13511\n",
      " I’m not jealous.\n",

      "13514\n",
      " Probably. What’s your point?\n",
      "13515\n",
      " No point. It’s just one of the things that makes one of the mes chuckle. What makes you chuckle, Leonard?\n",
      "13516\n",
      " Hmm, recently? Not much.\n",
      "13517\n",

      "13857\n",

      "13858\n",

      "13868\n",
      " Sure you can, you’re doing fine, it’s very believable.\n",
      "13869\n",
      " Look, I’m sorry Raj, but the truth is I was with Priya last night.\n",
      "13870\n",
      " Don’t listen to him, he’s still light headed from all the Irish whiskey and pickled eggs in his system.\n",
      "13871\n",
      " What were you doing with Priya?\n",
      "13872\n",
      " I believe they engaged in coitus but, more importantly, if Leonard had not abandoned his story, would you have found it plausible?\n",
      "13873\n",

      "13874\n",

      "13877\n",

      "13878\n",
      " Look, I admit it, I may have crossed a line here, but come on, Raj, your sister is a grown woman. To her, I’m a forbidden piece of white chocolate.\n",
      "13879\n",
      " I… I don’t believe it, this is a terrible betrayal of my trust.\n",
      "13880\n",
      " No, no, no, would it help if I told you that I offered her my heart and she kind of stomped on it.\n",
      "13881\n",
      " How hard did she stomp?\n",
      "13882\n",
      " Very hard.\n",
      "13883\n",
      " Okay, I’m good.\n",
      "13884\n",
      " Yeah, well, Raj, I just want to say that I’d never betray your trust. Unlike Leonard, I respect you.\n",
      "13885\n",
      " Really?\n",
      "13886\n",
      " Mmm.\n",
      "13887\n",

      "13888\n",
      " Dude! I put that thing on my face!\n",
      "13889\n",

      "13891\n",
      " That was all a lie? This year’s gifts are already wrapped!\n",
      "13892\n",
      " And as long as we’re talking about betraying our friends, how about the month Sheldon spent grinding up insects and mixing them into Leonard’s food.\n",
      "13893\n",
      " Well, excuse me. That was not a betrayal, that was an experiment to determine at what concentration food starts tasting mothy.\n",
      "13894\n",
      " You put moths in my food?\n",
      "13895\n",
      " For science.\n",
      "13896\n",
      " I can’t believe you kissed my sister with moth mouth.\n",
      "13897\n",
      " Well, uh, I can’t believe you used Sheldon’s toothbrush.\n",
      "13898\n",
      " You used my toothbrush?\n",
      "13899\n",
      " Not the brush part, just the little rubber thing to pick food from my teeth and massage my gums.\n",
      "13900\n",
      " Okay, I, I, I think it’s safe to say that we’ve all done some things we’re not particularly proud of. But come on, we’re friends. Friends overlook each other’s minor lapses. For the record, Howard, I’m sorry that I broke our pact.\n",
      "13901\n",
      " Thankyou, and I’m sorry about your phone. And Thanksgiving. And while we’re at it, you don’t have to wash our clothes on the fourth of July.\n",
      "13902\n",
      " As long as we’re apologising, Sheldon, I, I’m sorry I used your toothbrush.\n",
      "13903\n",
      " And I’m sorry. But that behaviour is beyond the pale and cannot be tolerated. We are no longer friends.\n",
      "13904\n",

      "13920\n",

      " Nothing. It was a desperate attempt to introduce an alternate topic of conversation.\n",
      "13922\n",
      " My problem is, I don’t project confidence. So I decided that the next time I meet a woman I think is attractive, rather than holding back and being cautious, I’m going to assume the mantle of self-assurance.\n",

      " What are you doing here?\n",
      "14033\n",
      " I have troubles, Penny. I’ve come to pour them out to the sympathetic ear of the local barkeep.\n",
      "14034\n",
      " You know, they have a really nice bar over at the Olive Garden.\n",
      "14035\n",
      " I don’t like the Olive Garden. They treat me like family.\n",
      "14036\n",
      " Okay, Sheldon. What can I get you?\n",
      "14037\n",
      " Alcohol.\n",
      "14038\n",
      " Could you be a little more specific?\n",
      "14039\n",
      " Ethyl alcohol. 40 millilitres.\n",
      "14040\n",
      " I’m sorry, honey, I don’t know millilitres.\n",
      "14041\n",
      " Ah. Blame President James “Jimmy” Carter. He started America on a path to the metric system but then just gave up. He wonders why he was a one-term president.\n",
      "14042\n",
      " More or less.\n",
      "14043\n",
      " Great. (Drinks the tequila) Now, where were we?\n",
      "14044\n",
      " I believe you were about to ask me to choose a cocktail. Fortunately, thanks to computer-savvy alcoholics, there’s an app for that. Let’s see. Harvey Wallbanger. Eh. Sex on the Beach. I hardly think so. Rob Roy, Silk Slipper, Mad Hatter. Ooh! I’ll have a Rosewater Ricky.\n",
      "14045\n",
      " A what?\n",
      "14046\n",
      " You’ll need pitted, brandied cherries, gin, rosewater, angostura bitters and overproofed rum. Now, first, dust the cherries with sugar, then spray them with a mixture of rum and bitters. Then ignite the rum, caramel…\n",
      "14047\n",
      " That’s not how it looks in the picture.\n",
      "14048\n",
      " Oh, yeah, you know, every bartender makes it differently. Why don’t you give it a try.\n",
      "14049\n",
      " All right. To the metric system. (Knocks back drink. Spits it all back into glass.) I can’t taste the cherries.\n",
      "14050\n",
      " All right. Sheldon, what’s on your mind?\n",
      "14051\n",
      " I wronged Howard, and he won’t accept my apology.\n",
      "14052\n",
      " Oh, right, that. Yes, Leonard told me. Sorry, honey.\n",
      "14053\n",
      " Penny, you face failure on a daily basis. How do you cope?\n",
      "14054\n",
      " I drink.\n",
      "14055\n",
      " To drinking. (Knocks back drink and spits it out again.) Nope. Oh, if only there were some way to force Howard to accept my apology so I could escape this miasma of guilt.\n",
      "14056\n",
      " You know, sometimes stuff just happens, and there’s nothing you can do about it. For example, Lisa Peterson hasn’t talked to me since the 11th grade, because no matter how much you apologize, you can’t go back and un-dry-hump someone’s boyfriend.\n",
      "14057\n",
      " I see. You’re saying I’m facing Starfleet Academy’s unwinnable command scenario, the Kobayashi Maru.\n",
      "14058\n",
      " Exactly. Sometimes you can’t win.\n",
      "14059\n",
      " Captain Kirk won.\n",
      "14060\n",
      " Kirk cheated.\n",
      "14061\n",
      " Impressive that you know that. It’s hard to believe I’m actually having this conversation with you.\n",
      "14062\n",
      " Right there with you.\n",
      "14063\n",
      " Kirk beat the Kobayashi Maru by reprogramming the simulator. That’s it.\n",
      "14064\n",
      " What?\n",
      "14065\n",
      " I’ll reprogram Howard.\n",
      "14066\n",
      " What? Sheldon, you can’t reprogram people.\n",
      "14067\n",
      " No, you can’t reprogram people. To James Tiberius Kirk. (Drinks. Leaves. Comes back and spits it out again.)\n",
      "14068\n",
      " Hello, all.\n",
      "14069\n",
      " Hello.\n",
      "14070\n",
      " Hey.\n",
      "14071\n",
      " Howard, you’re feeling better about me today, aren’t you?\n",
      "14072\n",
      " Not really.\n",
      "14073\n",
      " Yes, you are. I’m using neurolinguistic programming to modify your thought patterns.\n",
      "14074\n",
      " Oh. Go away, Sheldon.\n",
      "14075\n",
      " There’s a nine ninety five e-book down the drain.\n",
      "14076\n",
      " What’s in the bag?\n",
      "14077\n",
      " It’s for Howard.\n",
      "14078\n",
      " Oh. Sheldon, you can’t fix this with gifts.\n",
      "14079\n",
      " Nevertheless, I’ve hurt you, and whether you forgive me or not, I want you to have this.\n",
      "14080\n",
      " You’re giving me a couch cushion?\n",
      "14081\n",
      " No. The cushion is merely symbolic. I’m giving you my spot on the couch.\n",
      "14082\n",
      " But you love that spot.\n",
      "14083\n",
      " No. I love my mother. My feelings for my spot are much greater. It is the singular location in space around which revolves my entire universe. And now it’s yours.\n",
      "14084\n",
      " Oh, my God, dude. Now you have to forgive him.\n",
      "14085\n",
      " All right. Apology accepted.\n",
      "14086\n",
      " High five. Not too hard. Thank you.\n",
      "14087\n",
      " I haven’t cried like this since Toy Story 3.\n",
      "14088\n",
      " I got to tell you, Sheldon, I understand why you chose this spot. I mean, the temperature is good, but there’s no draft. I can see the television, but I can still talk to…\n",
      "14089\n",
      " I changed my mind. Get out of my spot.\n",
      "14090\n",
      " How long?\n",
      "14091\n",
      " 94 seconds.\n",
      "14092\n",
      " Okay, help me out here. How does an archaeology professor get that good with a whip?\n",
      "14093\n",
      " Maybe he took a class at the adult bookstore. That’s how I learned.\n",
      "14094\n",
      " I can’t believe you’ve never seen Raiders of the Lost Ark.\n",
      "14095\n",
      " And I can’t believe you’ve never read Eat, Pray, Love.\n",
      "14096\n",
      " When she comes out with Eat, Pray, Run Away From A Giant Boulder, I’ll read it.\n",
      "14097\n",
      " You know, I could totally rock a hat like that.\n",
      "14098\n",
      " That’s the work of noted Hollywood costume designer Deborah Nadoolman. She also designed the iconic red and black jacket in Michael Jackson’s Thriller video, which I’ve never viewed in its entirety, as I find zombies dancing in choreographed synchronicity implausible. And also, it’s really scary.\n",
      "14099\n",
      " Would someone please turn off the Sheldon commentary track?\n",
      "14100\n",
      " There’s no switch. Just listen and learn.\n",
      "14101\n",
      " Penny, if you think this is good, you should come with us Friday to see it on the big screen at the Colonial.\n",
      "14102\n",
      " Well, I’m watching it now. Why would I want to see it again on Friday?\n",
      "14103\n",
      " Because the print they’re showing on Friday has an additional 21 seconds of previously unseen footage.\n",
      "14104\n",
      " What, 21 seconds? That’ll be like seeing a whole new movie!\n",
      "14105\n",
      " Exactly. They say it finally solves the submarine controversy.\n",
      "14106\n",
      " Did Leonard? I’m no expert, but I believe what we just heard from Penny was sarcasm. (She indicates it was) Oh, good. I’m eight for 26 this month.\n",
      "14107\n",
      " Yeah, I think I’ll pass. But you guys enjoy your extra 21 seconds.\n",
      "14108\n",
      " Bet if I could make you understand why this is such a cool thing, we’d still be together.\n",
      "14109\n",
      " Mm, yeah, no, we wouldn’t.\n",
      "14110\n",
      " Uh-huh. I’m guessing 21 seconds had something to do with that, too.\n",
      "14111\n",
      " May I point out to you all that the screening is first come, first served?\n",
      "14112\n",
      " Relax, it’s five o’clock. The movie doesn’t start till midnight.\n",
      "14113\n",
      " Another way of saying that is the movie starts at midnight, and it’s already five o’clock. Let’s go.\n",
      "14114\n",
      " You know, if we miss it, we’ll have the fun of listening to Sheldon whine about it for the rest of our lives.\n",
      "14115\n",
      " See? Howard’s on my side.\n",
      "14116\n",
      " Actually, I’m not. I’m using sarcasm to mock you.\n",
      "14117\n",
      " Drat. Now I’m 8 for 27.\n",
      "14118\n",
      " Don’t worry, Sheldon. We’ll be fine.\n",
      "14119\n",
      " What happened to the Leonard Hofstadter who waited in line with me for 14 hours to see the midnight premiere of Star Trek: Nemesis?\n",
      "14120\n",
      " Oh. Well, he waited in line for 14 hours, while you napped in a lawn chair, he got in a fight with a Klingon when he stepped out of line to pee and you wouldn’t wake up to vouch for him, and worst of all, he saw Star Trek: Nemesis.\n",
      "14121\n",
      " But how were our seats?\n",
      "14122\n",
      " Excellent.\n",
      "14123\n",
      " I rest my case. Amy, don’t you agree we should leave now and get in line?\n",
      "14124\n",
      " Actually, as the newest member of your social group, I believe I’ll gain more acceptance by arbitrarily siding with your friends from time to time.\n",
      "14125\n",
      " Shrewd.\n",
      "14126\n",
      " Leonard, you’re right. We should enjoy our meal, arrive late, and risk winding up with terrible seats, assuming we get in at all.\n",
      "14127\n",
      " Thank you, Amy.\n",
      "14128\n",

      " Maybe. If it did, I’d be famous. I’d be on the cover of magazines. And then, instead of living alone in my tiny apartment, I’d have a big mansion.\n",

      " Hi. Ow. Hi.\n",
      "15187\n",
      " Yes. Bernie sure is.\n",
      "15188\n",
      " I’ll try to catch it.\n",
      "15189\n",
      " Bye.\n",

      " Yeah?\n",
      "15192\n",
      " Please tell me he’s your gay cousin.\n",
      "15193\n",
      " No. He was one of my professors in college.\n",
      "15194\n",
      " Oh! That’s a relief.\n",
      "15195\n",
      " Then we went out for a year. Come on, let’s check in, so we can take that nap.\n",
      "15196\n",
      " That green bag is Dr. Cooper’s. Here’s an extra five. Make him wait. Oh. Right to the nap, huh? Okay? Uh, so, this Glenn guy. You say you went out with him for, like, a year.\n",
      "15197\n",
      " Do we really need to talk about my old boyfriend now?\n",
      "15198\n",
      " No. I guess not. What is he, like, six-four, six-five?\n",
      "15199\n",
      " Six-seven.\n",
      "15200\n",

      "15203\n",
      " What?\n",
      "15204\n",

      " Howard, it’s not a contest. I love you. I want to be with you.\n",
      "15206\n",
      " Yeah, great, love you, too, but, if it were a contest, I wouldn’t have a chance, right?\n",
      "15207\n",
      " You can’t think that way.\n",
      "15208\n",
      " Yep. Loser.\n",
      "15209\n",
      " Howard, stop it.\n",
      "15210\n",
      " Sorry. I just never figured that a guy like me going out with a girl like you would ever have to compete with a guy like that.\n",
      "15211\n",
      " Wait a minute, a girl like me? What’s that mean?\n",
      "15212\n",
      " I’m… I…\n",
      "15213\n",
      " Are you saying you don’t think I’m hot enough to go out with a guy like Glenn?\n",
      "15214\n",
      " No! No, I’m saying exactly the opposite.\n",
      "15215\n",
      " I’m too hot to go out with a guy like Glenn?\n",
      "15216\n",
      " Yeah, let’s go with that.\n",
      "15217\n",
      " Will do.\n",
      "15218\n",
      " So, girl talk?\n",
      "15219\n",
      " Um, sure. What do you, what do you got in mind?\n",
      "15220\n",
      " Do you subscribe to the Freudian theory of penis envy?\n",
      "15221\n",
      " Um, I never really thought about it. Why?\n",
      "15222\n",
      " Sometimes I think it might be nice to have one.\n",
      "15223\n",
      " Really?\n",
      "15224\n",
      " Not for sex, for convenience. You can’t deny that, by comparison, our internal plumbing is extremely high maintenance.\n",
      "15225\n",

      " Oh, right, right, the blog.\n",
      "15236\n",
      " Word of warning, though. I’m prone to night terrors, so if I wake up kicking and screaming, don’t panic. Just pin me down and stroke my hair, and I’ll be fine.\n",
      "15237\n",
      " Hey, can I stay here tonight?\n",

      "15247\n",
      " We’re just gonna have to make the best of this.\n",
      "15248\n",
      " Okay, when you say make the best of it.\n",
      "15249\n",
      " Sleep.\n",
      "15250\n",
      " Right. So we’ll just call the middle here the Neutral Zone.\n",
      "15251\n",
      " The what?\n",
      "15252\n",
      " Star Trek. You know, the Neutral Zone between the Federation and the Romulan Empire.\n",

I agreed to speak to you this evening, because I was told that you’re the best and the brightest of this university’s doctoral candidates. Hmm. Of course, that’s like saying you are the most important electron in a hydrogen atom. ‘Cause, you see, there’s only one electron in a hydrogen atom. Best and brightest, my sweet patootie.

      "15378\n",
      " You want an acting lesson?\n",
      "15379\n",
      " Perhaps two. I’d like to master the craft.\n",
      "15380\n",
      " Okay, where is this coming from?\n",
      "15381\n",
      " It has been suggested to me that acting techniques could improve my lecturing, at which, if certain tweets and blogs are to be believed, I suck the big one.\n",
      "15382\n",
      " Yeah, I saw those. They were funny. I printed a few out and put ’em on my fridge.\n",
      "15383\n",
      " So, when could we start?\n",
      "15384\n",
      " Okay, just to be clear. You are asking me for help because I know something that the brilliant Dr. Sheldon Cooper doesn’t.\n",
      "15385\n",
      " I suppose that’s one way to look at it.\n",
      "15386\n",

      "15387\n",
      " Are you going to help me or not?\n",
      "15388\n",
      " Probably. I’m just enjoying the foreplay. Does this mean you are done mocking my acting career?\n",
      "15389\n",
      " Oh, I’m sorry, I thought making the transition from actor to acting teacher was the signal that one’s career had reached the end of the road.\n",

      " What?\n",
      "15395\n",
      " I just got offered a fellowship at the Weitzmann Institute in Israel.\n",
      "15396\n",
      " Dude, that’s incredible!\n",
      "15397\n",

      " What kind of needs?\n",
      "15402\n",
      " Sexual needs.\n",
      "15403\n",
      " Most of them regular, some of them kind of messed up.\n",

      " So, while I’m gone, you’re going to have to satisfy her.\n",
      "15405\n",

      "15406\n",

      "15410\n",
      " Nothing. I was acting.\n",
      "15411\n",
      " You were acting?\n",
      "15412\n",
      " Yes. In preparation for today’s studies, I read Stanislavski’s An Actor Prepares, Stella Adler’s\n",
      "15413\n",
      " Well, good for you. Come on in.\n",
      "15414\n",
      " How shall we begin?\n",
      "15415\n",
      " Well, I thought we’d start with some basic movement exercises. You know, get our bodies warmed up a little.\n",
      "15416\n",
      " All right.\n",
      "15417\n",
      " So I just want you to relax and kind of move around in the space. You know, just do whatever feels natural. Sheldon?\n",
      "15418\n",
      " Come on, you got to work with me. We need to get connected with our bodies.\n",
      "15419\n",
      " Penny, my body and I have a relationship that works best when we maintain a cool, wary distance from each other.\n",
      "15420\n",
      " All right, let’s just say we’ve warmed up.\n",
      "15421\n",
      " You’re the teacher.\n",
      "15422\n",
      " Okay. One of the things that might help you in connecting with your students is being a little more spontaneous. So why don’t we try some improvisation?\n",
      "15423\n",
      " Why not? It seems like you’re improvising your entire curriculum.\n",
      "15424\n",
      " This is all about listening and responding.\n",
      "15425\n",
      " Gotcha.\n",
      "15426\n",
      " I’m going to create a character and a situation, and you just jump in when you feel it.\n",
      "15427\n",
      " All right.\n",
      "15428\n",
      " All right.\n",

      " Action.\n",
      "15430\n",

      "15431\n",
      " Hey, you taught me something. Who would have thought it?\n",
      "15432\n",
      " Okay. Uh, no, the shipment has not arrived, and I really need those shoes. They are my biggest seller. Yes, ladies sizes six through ten. Thank you. Oh, sorry, I have to go, I have a customer. Bye-bye. Hi. Can I help you?\n",
      "15433\n",
      " I’d like a frozen yogurt, please.\n",
      "15434\n",
      " Yogurt?\n",
      "15435\n",
      " Yeah.\n",
      "15436\n",
      " Um, okay, sure. Luckily, we sell both shoes and yogurt here.\n",
      "15437\n",
      " You do?\n",
      "15438\n",
      " Yes. Look up at the sign, and remember, improv is always about saying yes.\n",
      "15439\n",
      " All right. Yes. I see a sign. It says Camarillo State Mental Hospital.\n",
      "15440\n",
      " What?\n",
      "15441\n",
      " It’s the only explanation I can come up with for why you think you sell shoes and yogurt.\n",
      "15442\n",
      " Okay, you know what? Let’s just try a different improv. Uh, oh, this time we will be two winos living under a freeway overpass.\n",
      "15443\n",
      " Oh, and we’re going to use props?\n",
      "15444\n",

      "15448\n",
      " What happened?\n",
      "15449\n",

      " It’ll be okay. It’ll be okay.\n",
      "15455\n",
      " It’ll be okay. It’ll be okay. (Phone rings) It’s Howard. Howard, hello.\n",

      "15457\n",
      " Yeah, I’m right here, buddy. How are you?\n",

      " Shh, shh. Listen to me. I’m not gonna make it.\n",
      "15459\n",
      " No, no, no, don’t say that. You’re going to be all right.\n",
      "15460\n",
      " Raj, I don’t have time. Now, pay attention. My last wish is that you look after Bernadette.\n",
      "15461\n",
      " Of course, of course. Now when you say look after, you mean…\n",
      "15462\n",
      " Sexually.\n",
      "15463\n",
      " Excuse me, Bernadette. I have to hear it from him.\n",
      "15464\n",
      " Sexually.\n",
      "15465\n",
      " Got it. Take care. I guess I have no choice but to make sweet, guilt-free love to you over and over again for the rest of my life.\n",
      "15466\n",
      " That’s how I heard it.\n",
      "15467\n",

      " S-Y-F-Y. Sy-fee.\n",

      " Oh, right. Good one.\n",
      "15470\n",
      " So, did you get a chance to go over the scene I gave you?\n",
      "15471\n",
      " Yes. I didn’t care for it.\n",
      "15472\n",
      " Okay, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is an American classic.\n",
      "15473\n",
      " So is the McRib sandwich. I don’t care for that, either.\n",
      "15474\n",
      " Fine. What would you rather do as a scene study?\n",
      "15475\n",
      " I’m glad you asked. I took the liberty of adapting a Star Trek fan fiction novella I wrote when I was ten into a one-act play.\n",
      "15476\n",
      " And you think it’s better than Tennessee Williams?\n",
      "15477\n",

      " Okay, that’s fine, but let’s try and get you out of your comfort zone.\n",

      " Why would we want to do that? It’s called the comfort zone for a reason.\n",
      "15484\n",
      " Okay, the whole point of this is to loosen you up a little, so I’m thinking you’ll play the role of your mother, and I will bring life to Mr. Spock.\n",

If a woman’s father is not around, the duty of controlling her base desires falls to the closest male member of her family, in this case, Raj. The code also states that if she disobeys, she will be reborn in the womb of a jackal and tormented by diseases. If true, that seems like an awfully large gamble given that the prize is Leonard.\n",

      " Well, granted, Penny, your secondary sexual characteristics are reasonably bodacious. But Priya is highly educated, she’s an accomplished professional, and she comes from the culture that literally wrote the book on neat ways to have sex. Whereas you, on the other hand, are a community college dropout who comes from the culture that wrote the book on tipping cows.\n",

      " Yeah. Okay, I got it. I got it. So, what is all that stuff?\n",
      "15797\n",

      "15828\n",
      " Oh, wow. I love Taming of the Shrew. I did a paper on it in high school. Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting? In his tail.\n",

      "15837\n",
      " A little snack. You got any string cheese?\n",
      "15838\n",
      " No. I, I might have some cheddar.\n",
      "15839\n",
      " Not as good. You can’t make strings with it. Remind me to put it on your shopping list.\n",

      " Okay.\n",
      "15841\n",

      "15842\n",
      " No.\n",

      "15844\n",
      " Wait a second. I’m doing your laundry?\n",
      "15845\n",
      " Well, honey, it’s not gonna do itself. Oh, before I forget, tomorrow morning, you’re driving me to the dentist.\n",
      "15846\n",
      " I have to take you?\n",
      "15847\n",
      " You don’t have to take me. You get to take me.\n",
      "15848\n",
      " Wait a minute. Are you telling me your mother usually takes you to the dentist?\n",
      "15849\n",
      " It’s not weird. There’s lots of kids there with their moms.\n",
      "15850\n",
      " I can’t believe this.\n",
      "15851\n",
      " What? It’s fun. If I have no cavities, afterwards, we go out for a treat.\n",
      "15852\n",
      " All right, Howard, let’s get something straight right now. I’m not going to be your mother.\n",
      "15853\n",
      " Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where did that come from?\n",
      "15854\n",
      " Nobody wants to do that to you, Ma.\n",
      "15855\n",
      " Didn’t you read my email?\n",

      "15861\n",
      " I already told you, I’m okay with it. I mean, if anything, I’m quite pleased (starting to blub) that Leonard has found someone (starting to blub) that makes him so happy.\n",
      "15862\n",
      " It’s okay, it’s okay.\n",
      "15863\n",
      " Thank you.\n",

      "15885\n",
      " Un momento. Oh, for heaven’s sake, now you’re being deliberately stupid. (to Leonard) Where are you going?\n",

      " Can’t we make a one-time exception for tonight?\n",
      "15889\n",
      " We could. We could also stop using the letter M, but I think that idea is isguided and oronic.\n",
      "15890\n",

      "15891\n",
      " Well, I don’t want to go to a party.\n",

      "15894\n",
      " How come it’s not a party when we do it here?\n",

Every Thursday night for the last eight years, you and I and our friends have gathered here in this very spot to break bread covered with cheese and sauce, discuss the issues of the day, and yes, share a laugh or two. But I guess our rich heritage means nothing to you.\n",

      " A lot of people think I’m fun to be around.\n",
      "15956\n",
      " Don’t be needy, bestie. That’s probably part of what chased Leonard away. What I am saying, Sheldon, is that your group is Leonard-centric. If it were a town, it would be Leonardville. If it were an Islamic nation, Leonardstan. If it were the birthplace of motion pictures, we’d all be singing Hooray for Leonardwood.\n",
      "15957\n",
      " Ooh, I got one. If you guys were a band, you’d be called Leonard and the Leonards.\n",
      "15958\n",

      "15964\n",

      "15982\n",
      " Well, it would appear LeVar Burton won’t be joining us so let’s get started. Um, I thought we’d begin by going around the room, introducing ourselves and saying a little bit about why we’re here. Okay. I’m Sheldon. Uh, for regular readers of The New England Journal of High Energy Physics, I need no introduction. If you’re not familiar with that publication, there’s a free copy in your goody bag. Stuart?\n",
      "15983\n",
      " That’s very nice, Stuart. Zack?\n",
      "15984\n",
      " Of course. Barry?\n",
      "15985\n",

      " We’re here to kidnap you for a girls’ night out.\n",
      "15992\n",
      " Parenthetical, the term kidnap is being used playfully.\n",
      "15993\n",
      " I kind of figured that.\n",
      "15994\n",
      " Good. Now put this pillowcase over your head.\n",

      " No.\n",

      " Yes.\n",
      "16002\n",
      " Sure.\n",

      " Question. Was it a Jacuzzi or a hot tub?\n",
      "16006\n",
      " Jacuzzi is a commercial brand. Hot tub is the generic term, i.e., all Jacuzzis are hot tubs, but not all hot tubs are Jacuzzis.\n",
      "16007\n",
      " Surprisingly, yes.\n",
      "16008\n",
      " The water level rose.\n",
      "16009\n",
      " Of course it did. It’s said that Archimedes, the ancient Greek mathematician, discovered the principle of displacement while taking a bath.\n",
      "16010\n",
      " Forgive me, but I think you’ll find my story is more interesting.\n",
      "16011\n",
      " Better. It has a gold crown. You see, the king wondered how much gold was in it and charged Archimedes with coming up with the solution. Because the crown was irregularly shaped, there was no way to mathematically determine its volume. But, while bathing, Archimedes realized he could immerse the crown and measure the amount the water rose.\n",
      "16012\n",
      " When he finished, he shouted Eureka!\n",
      "16013\n",
      " All right, that concludes the getting to know you portion of the evening. Who’s ready to play some vintage video games?

      "16127\n",

      "16129\n",

      "16132\n",
      " Sure. Oh, god, you smell so good. Of course, that could just be my other senses getting stronger. Hypothetically, if I had access To a Lieutenant Uhura uniform, would you wear it?\n",

      "16605\n",
      " Then we’ll track its progress through our social group and interpret the results through the competing academic prisms of memetic theory, algebraic gossip and epidemiology.\n",

      "16608\n",

      "16611\n",
      " Uh-huh. So, uh, Howard’s not here?\n",
      "16612\n",
      " No. It’s just one of those times when it’s just you and me. Like when the three of us went to the movies and you and I waited outside the bathroom while Howard threw up Red Vines and Cherry Coke. Do you remember that?\n",
      "16613\n",
      " Yeah.\n",
      "16614\n",

      "16619\n",
      " I was when I came in, but it’s amazing what liquor does to guilt. Besides what you might not know is, Bernadette is planning on breaking up with Howard.\n",

      " Well, I know that. How do you know that?\n",
      "16621\n",

      "16622\n",
      " Oh, that gossipy bitch! No offense.\n",
      "16623\n",
      " None taken. You should hear how she talks about you.\n",
      "16624\n",
      " Okay, listen, just because Howard and Bernadette are having problems, does not mean you should be here sniffing around.\n",
      "16625\n",
      " What can I do? I can’t stop thinking about her.\n",
      "16626\n",

      "16627\n",
      " Shut your ass!\n",
      "16628\n",
      " Yeah, it’s true. Amy told me.\n",
      "16629\n",
      " How did that even happen? Did they know that’s what they were doing when they were doing it?\n",
      "16630\n",
      " I-I guess they just figured it out at some point.\n",
      "16631\n",
      " Wow. I can’t believe old Smelly Pooper finally got laid.\n",
      "16632\n",
      " Hey.\n",

      " Hey.\n",
      "16634\n",

      "16637\n",
      " Yes, I believe so.\n",
      "16638\n",
      " Good, good. Everything okay between you two?\n",
      "16639\n",
      " Yes. Why do you ask?\n",
      "16640\n",
      " No reason. I was just talking to Raj, and he mentioned what a lovely glow she has these days.\n",
      "16641\n",
      " Did he mean as if she’d been out in the sun, tending an herb garden without wearing a hat or sunblock?\n",
      "16642\n",
      " No. That’s not what he meant.\n",
      "16643\n",
      " Well, we may never know. As my mother would say, the Asians are an inscrutable folk. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have work to do.\n",
      "16644\n",
      " Yeah, you do. You dog, you.\n",

      "16646\n",

      "16648\n",
      " I must say, Amy, pretending to have intercourse with you is giving me a great deal of satisfaction.\n",

      "16650\n",

      " No. Happy accident.\n",
      "16655\n",
      " This is remarkable. Took less than 24 hours.\n",
      "16656\n",
      " I should let you know that she asked for details about our dalliance.\n",
      "16657\n",
      " Interesting. So it went beyond the mere fact of coitus to a blow by blow, as it were.\n",
      "16658\n",
      " Pun intended?\n",
      "16659\n",
      " I’m sorry. What pun?\n",
      "16660\n",
      " Not important. I described your lovemaking as aloof, but effective.\n",
      "16661\n",
      " I wish you hadn’t done that. That’s going to make me a chick magnet, and I’m so busy as it is.\n",

      "17398\n",
      " Well, there are a couple of opportunities available, but I volunteered for the premature ejaculation project. I mean, it’s not like either one of us has heart disease. Oh, I almost forgot. I got you a little present.\n",
      "17399\n",

      " When a suitcase just won’t do.\n",
      "17411\n",
      " Mmm, all right. It would appear as if alcohol is playing keep-away with your intelligence. Good night. Please note, it is now past ten p.m. Per our roommate agreement, kindly refrain from raucous laughter, clinking of glasses, and celebratory gunfire.\n",
      "17412\n",
      " Okay, explain something to me. You watch Leonard put up with that guy for years and years. What has to break inside your brain for you to think, Oh, Krishna, I’ve got to get me some of that?\n",
      "17413\n",
      " Well, it’s a lot better than having to wear noise-cancelling headphones in my own apartment.\n",

      " Yeah.\n",

The procedure for diagnosing pinworms is to wait until the subject is asleep, and the worms crawl out of the rectum for air. (Leonard spits out food) Yes, just like that.

Sign it in a way that I sound humble with just a hint of, that’s right, I had servants.\n",

      " She says, sure, what about him?\n",
      "18134\n",
      " Okay, um, gosh, how do I start? Um, see, Raj is kind of naive. I mean, he hasn’t dated a whole lot of women. And I’m concerned that, without meaning to, you might be taking advantage of him. You know, by letting him buy you a bunch of expensive things.And I.. I… Howard, focus. Tell her what I’m saying.\n",

      " I’m hammered.\n",
      "18141\n",

      "18382\n",
      " It’s kind of like the Loch Ness monster. Maybe there’s something there, maybe there isn’t. We’ll probably never know. But sometimes it’s fun to creep yourself out thinking about it.\n",
      "18383\n",

      " Did you try calling her on the telephone?\n",
      "18691\n",

      "18709\n",
      " Point of order. As you’re in distress, it would be customary for me to offer you a hot beverage. But I’m a guest in your home, so it would be customary for you to offer me a beverage. How do you want to proceed vis-a-vis beverages?\n",

And if I may suggest, consider changing disciplines. Yeah, to the humanities, perhaps history. One of the advantages of teaching history is that you don’t have to create things, you know, you just have to remember stuff that happened and then parrot it back. You could have fun with that.\n",

      "19521\n",

      "19538\n",
      " You look beautiful.\n",
      "19539\n",
      " Of course I do, I’m a princess, and this is my tiara!\n",
      "19540\n",
      " You’re right, the tiara was too much.\n",
      "19541\n",
      " Here’s your vest back.\n",
      "19542\n",
      " You should keep it. You could wear it again sometime.\n",
      "19543\n",
      " Where?\n",
      "19544\n",
      " I don’t know, hunting?\n",
      "19545\n",
      " Don’t worry, Ma. I will, as soon as I can figure out a way to bring up such a sensitive issue!\n",
      "19546\n",
      " I guess you talked to your mom, huh?\n",
      "19547\n",
      " I was upset. My mom can be a pretty good shoulder to cry on, if the smell of Bengay doesn’t burn your eyes.\n",
      "19548\n",
      " Look, it’s obvious having kids is really important to you, and I think I came up with a solution.\n",
      "19549\n",
      " Really? That’s great. What?\n",
      "19550\n",
      " Well, seeing as how I make way more money than you anyway, what if I work and you stay home with the kids?\n",
      "19551\n",
      " Me?\n",
      "19552\n",
      " Yeah. You know, you’ll watch Barney and pull Cheerios out of their noses and go on play dates, and I’ll work and have conversations with people my own age and enjoy my life.\n",
      "19553\n",
      " Yeah.\n",
      "19554\n",
      " Yay, so we’re good.\n",
      "19555\n",
      " Yeah, we’re good.\n",
      "19556\n",
      " You know, I don’t know if this counted as a fight, but how about some make-up sex?\n",
      "19557\n",
      " I would love that. But what is that behind your ear? Oh, look, it’s a condom.\n",
      "19558\n",
      " You feel like trying something new for dinner? Maybe Indian, Tex-Mex?\n",
      "19559\n",
      " You ever wonder how humans would be different if they evolved from lizards instead of mammals?\n",
      "19560\n",
      " Okay, let’s talk about that.\n",
      "19561\n",
      " As you know, lizards, cold-blooded animals, lack the ability to sense temperature. But they do move more sluggishly when it’s cold. So, lizard weathermen would say things like, bring a sweater, it’s slow outside. I love my mind.\n",
      "19562\n",
      " We all do. Now, how about dinner?\n",
      "19563\n",
      " Oh, I would assume we’d enjoy insects or smaller lizards. We could also pull each other’s tails off and grill them, they’ll just grow back. Oh! My life-size cardboard Mr. Spock is here! I know he wouldn’t care for an outburst of human emotion, but, oh goodie, oh goodie, oh goodie. Commander Spock requesting permission to be unfolded.\n",
      "19564\n",
      " Permission granted, Commander.\n",
      "19565\n",
      " Which is why the more intelligent the monkey, the more faeces they fling.\n",

      " Excuse me, Amy. Penny, do you have plans for dinner tonight?\n",
      "19567\n",
      " Why, you guys going somewhere?\n",
      "19568\n",
      " No, I mean just you and me.\n",
      "19569\n",
      " You mean, like a date?\n",
      "19570\n",
      " Not like a date, a date.\n",
      "19571\n",
      " Ooh!\n",
      "19572\n",
      " Ooh!\n",
      "19573\n",
      " Um, o-okay. Sure.\n",
      "19574\n",
      " Ooh!\n",
      "19575\n",
      " Ooh!\n",

      " Oh, no! They sent the wrong Spock! Live long and suck it, Zachary Quinto.\n",
      "19577\n",
      " This is so exciting. If Leonard and Penny get back together, Howard and I can go on double dates with them.\n",
      "19578\n",
      " How come you never invite Sheldon and me on a double date?\n",
      "19579\n",
      " Mm, uh… How’s it going in there, Penny?\n",
      "19580\n",
      " Just a sec. (Emerges in revealing slinky green dress) Too much?\n",
      "19581\n",
      " Yes.\n",
      "19582\n",
      " No.\n",
      "19583\n",
      " Okay, just hang on.\n",
      "19584\n",
      " You just can’t handle her raw sexuality, can you?\n",
      "19585\n",
      " When did you and Leonard break up?\n",
      "19586\n",
      " Uh, about two years ago.\n",
      "19587\n",
      " Why do you think he asked you out again?\n",
      "19588\n",
      " I don’t know.\n",
      "19589\n",
      " Maybe he’s dying. That would be so romantic.\n",
      "19590\n",
      " He’s not dying.\n",
      "19591\n",
      " Too bad. If he were, she could just throw him in bed and ride him right up until he flatlines.\n",
      "19592\n",
      " How about this?\n",
      "19593\n",
      " Maybe.\n",

      " Come on.\n",
      "19595\n",
      " Yeah, okay, no.\n",
      "19596\n",
      " Do you think you’ll sleep with him tonight?\n",
      "19597\n",
      " Absolutely not. Look, we’re just gonna have dinner and, you know, see how it goes.\n",
      "19598\n",
      " If he were dying, would you sleep with him?\n",
      "19599\n",
      " What?\n",
      "19600\n",
      " Assuming he were dying of something that couldn’t be sexually transmitted. You know, like a spear wound to the head.\n",
      "19601\n",
      " Okay, he is not dying.\n",
      "19602\n",
      " How do you know? Are you a doctor?\n",
      "19603\n",
      " You can make-believe, though. Sometimes Howard and I pretend that his arrhythmia is acting up and I’m a sexy cardiologist. And the naughty part is I’m not in his HMO network.\n",
      "19604\n",
      " Screw it. I’m not gonna make a big deal out of this. It’s just dinner.\n",
      "19605\n",
      " With a dead man.\n",
      "19606\n",
      " Amy, stop it. Oh, God, I’m so nervous.\n",
      "19607\n",
      " Relax. You know Leonard’s always been crazy about you. It’s gonna be great.\n",
      "19608\n",
      " I know, but we’ve finally gotten to a place where we can hang out without it being weird. And what if something goes wrong? Then what?\n",
      "19609\n",
      " Guess it’ll just be Sheldon and me going on a double date with Howard and Bernadette.\n",
      "19610\n",
      " Sure, we’d love that. Change your clothes, we got a lot riding on this.\n",
      "19611\n",
      " Mm. I want to build a road, but I need wood. Do either of you fellows have wood? (Raj and Howard snigger) I don’t understand the laughter. The object of Settlers of Catan is to build roads and settlements. To do so requires wood. Now, I have sheep; I need wood. Who has wood for my sheep?\n",
      "19612\n",
      " Okay, how do I look?\n",
      "19613\n",
      " Well, more to the point, why are you doing this?\n",
      "19614\n",
      " What are you talking about?\n",
      "19615\n",
      " Did you forget what Penny did to you? It took you two years and defiling my sister to turn that frown upside down.\n",
      "19616\n",
      " I didn’t defile your sister, we had a relationship.\n",
      "19617\n",
      " I heard you call her Brown Sugar. In my book, that’s defilement.\n",
      "19618\n",
      " You want to know my opinion?\n",
      "19619\n",
      " Oh, boy, do I?\n",
      "19620\n",
      " Sarcasm?\n",
      "19621\n",
      " No.\n",
      "19622\n",
      " All right, then. The reason you’re fixated on a good-natured simpleton like Penny is that she’s the exact opposite of your first romantic attachment, your brilliant yet intimidating mother.\n",
      "19623\n",
      " Where on earth did you get that from?\n",
      "19624\n",
      " It’s in her book, Needy Baby, Greedy Baby.\n",
      "19625\n",
      " That doesn’t make it true.\n",
      "19626\n",
      " It’s called non-fiction for a reason, Leonard.\n",
      "19627\n",
      " See you later.\n",
      "19628\n",
      " If they ever make a movie version of that book, you know who should play Leonard’s mother? Sandra Bullock.\n",
      "19629\n",
      " Why?\n",
      "19630\n",
      " Because she’s great in everything.\n",
      "19631\n",
      " Now, where were we? Oh, yes. Does anyone have any wood? Oh, come on! I just want wood. Why are you making it so hard?\n",
      "19632\n",
      " So, do they have a name for a first date with someone you used to go out with?\n",
      "19633\n",
      " Oh, that’s a good question. How about awkward?\n",
      "19634\n",
      " Yeah, that sounds right.\n",
      "19635\n",
      " Yeah?\n",
      "19636\n",
      " Hey, how about if we pretend we’re actually on a first date? See how that goes.\n",
      "19637\n",
      " Okay.\n",
      "19638\n",
      " So, Polly, tell me about yourself.\n",
      "19639\n",
      " It’s Penny.\n",
      "19640\n",
      " Oh, sorry, yeah. Awkward.\n",
      "19641\n",
      " Okay, uh, let’s see. I’m from Nebraska, and ever since I was a little girl, I dreamed of moving to L.A. and becoming a movie star. Anyway, after four years of acting lessons and waiting tables, I’ve done a haemorrhoid commercial and a production of Anne Frank above a bowling alley. So, you know, dreams do come true. Your turn.\n",
      "19642\n",
      " Uh, let’s see. Uh, I am an experimental physicist at Cal-Tech, most of my research is with high-powered lasers, and, oh, I’ve just gotten a big government grant to see if they can be used to knock out incoming ballistic missiles.\n",
      "19643\n",
      " Wow. Can they?\n",
      "19644\n",

      "19646\n",

      "19647\n",
      " What does that mean?\n",
      "19648\n",
      " Uh, it means if anyone displeases me, I don’t help them set up their printer.\n",
      "19649\n",
      " You are so funny.\n",
      "19650\n",
      " Good. Remember that when I take my shirt off.\n",

      " Leonard, this is nice. I’m so glad we did this.\n",
      "19652\n",
      " Me, too. So what do you think? Are we gonna get back together?\n",
      "19653\n",
      " Whoa. Not so fast.\n",
      "19654\n",
      " I’m sorry, what did I say?\n",
      "19655\n",
      " Leonard, you know I will always have feelings for you.\n",
      "19656\n",
      " Oh, God.\n",
      "19657\n",
      " What?\n",
      "19658\n",
      " You said always. You’ll always have feelings for me.\n",
      "19659\n",
      " So?\n",
      "19660\n",
      " So, that sounds more like something you’d say if you didn’t want a relationship with someone. This isn’t working out, but I’ll always have feelings for you. I’m sorry I slept with your best friend, but I’ll always have feelings for you. Here’s the thing, Lisa, I’m into dudes now, but I’ll always have feelings for you.\n",
      "19661\n",

      "20554\n",
      " You threw up?\n",
      "20555\n",
      " Yeah, and the craziest part is, because there’s no gravity, the throw-up kind of floats there, in a little ball, and if your mouth is open because you’re screaming, sometimes it just floats right back in. Boy, does everyone laugh at you when that happens.\n",
      "20556\n",
      " That sounds mean.\n",
      "20557\n",

Trust me, if you were even a little conscious right now, you’d be laughing. Anyway, there’s new studies that show, people in comas are aware of everything going on around them. With that in mind, if you can hear me, move away from the light and toward the sound of these scissors.\n",
      "20561\n",
      " Yes. Do you have something I could use as a cape?\n",

      " Uh, sweetie, are you all right?\n",
      "20579\n",

I even contacted the Centres For Disease Control to find out what shots they recommend for travel to Orange County. FYI, it’s none.\n",
      "20685\n",

      " You use it to get your way.\n",
      "20687\n",

      "20703\n",
      " Look, if you don’t want to go to the party, just don’t go. You’re a grown man. Act like one. Tell Amy you want to spend the weekend having a sleepover and playing video games with your friends. Maybe she’ll dig it. Women like a firm hand on the tiller.\n",

      " I don’t think I’d be good at that.\n",
      "20812\n",

      " You’re hurting me.\n",

      " Oh.\n",
      "20827\n",
      " I think I understand. You’re the one person who can say Sheldon Cooper is your boyfriend, but that rings hollow if you can’t lord him over others in the flesh. I forget what I bring to the party and what I take away when I leave. Please accept these valuable Cooper Coupons as restitution.\n",
      "20828\n",
      " Sheldon, she doesn’t want your stupid…\n",

      "20831\n",
      " But e-excuse me, I have something to say. None of you may realize it, but I was very much looking forward to this weekend. It was gonna be like the old days, the four of us hanging out playing video games before you guys all got girlfriends. Do you have any idea what it’s like to be the only one without a girlfriend? Even if I get one someday, I’ll still be the guy who got a girl after Sheldon Cooper!\n",
      "20832\n",
      " And that’s how a girl makes a scene. I’m sorry, sweetie. You’re right. You deserve your weekend. Come on, Amy, let’s go.\n",
      "20833\n",
      " What about the Science Center?\n",

      " No, I’ll…\n",

      " Just leave! Okay, now. This is the way it’s supposed to be. Men together, fighting the forces of evil.\n",

      "20843\n",

      "20845\n",
      " Oh, you know what they say, the best things in life are free.\n",
      "20846\n",
      " Okay, you’re right, I eat your food a lot. How about this, you can raid my fridge any time you want.\n",
      "20847\n",
      " Oh, that’s very kind of you. Next time I have a hankering to wash down a D cell battery with a jar of old pickle juice, I’ll come a-knocking.\n",
      "20848\n",
      " Hey, Raj, you didn’t send your RSVP in. I’m supposed to ask you if you’re bringing someone to the wedding.\n",
      "20849\n",
      " I’ll let you know.\n",
      "20850\n",
      " Well, can you make it soon. There’s a battle royale going on over the seating charts. In one corner, Bernadette’s mom, and the other three, mine.\n",
      "20851\n",
      " Yeah, I hate wedding receptions. I wish the bride and groom would take a cue from Bilbo Baggins, slip on the ring, disappear and everyone goes home.\n",
      "20852\n",
      " Mmm, you liked Professor Guyster’s wedding.\n",
      "20853\n",
      " They had a make your own sundae bar. Ooh, that was a night to remember. Do you know, on the one trip, I just had a bowl of nuts.\n",
      "20854\n",
      " Anyway, you gotta let me know if you have a plus one, because if not my mom’s trying to sneak in the doctor who sucked the fat out of her neck.\n",
      "20855\n",
      " Alright, uh, fine, I’m coming and I’m bringing somebody. Uh, Koothrappali plus one.\n",

      "20857\n",
      " Who are you bringing?\n",

      "20859\n",
      " Wow, what a bunch of Nosey O’Donnells.\n",
      "20860\n",
      " Come on, who is it?\n",
      "20861\n",
      " I’m not telling. I’m from Asia. I’m mysterious. Deal with it.\n",
      "20862\n",
      " Howard, are you having a make your own sundae bar?\n",
      "20863\n",
      " No, uh, I don’t think so.\n",
      "20864\n",
      " Well you should. 50% of marriages end in divorce, but 100% of make your own sundae bars end in happiness.\n",
      "20865\n",
      " Listen, uh, there’s something I want to talk to you about. I, I wasn’t ready until now, but I think it’s time.\n",
      "20866\n",
      " No, I’m not gay. If anything, I’m metrosexual.\n",
      "20867\n",
      " It means I like women as well as their skincare products.\n",
      "20868\n",

      "20869\n",
      " Yes.\n",
      "20870\n",

      "20874\n",
      " Sure, what’s up?\n",
      "20875\n",
      " Well, I was thinking about Sheldon’s little joke the other night about me eating all your food.\n",
      "20876\n",
      " Oh, that was no joke. But I understand your confusion as I am our group’s resident cut-up.\n",
      "20877\n",
      " I’m sorry, you are our resident cut-up?\n",
      "20878\n",
      " Yes.\n",
      "20879\n",
      " Prove it.\n",
      "20880\n",
      " Knock, knock.\n",
      "20881\n",

      " Interrupting physi…\n",
      "20884\n",
      " MUON!\n",
      "20885\n",
      " Anyway, I got a little residual cheque from my commercial and I thought, hey, how about I get the guys a little thankyou to pay them back. So, Sheldon, ta-da!\n",
      "20886\n",
      " Ah! A vintage, mint in box, 1975 Mego Star Trek transporter with real transporter action. Hot-darn!\n",
      "20887\n",
      " Where did you get that?\n",
      "20888\n",
      " Uh, from Stuart at the comic-book store.\n",
      "20889\n",
      " You went to the comic-book store by yourself?\n",
      "20890\n",
      " Yeah, it was fun, I walked in and two different guys got asthma attacks. Felt pretty good.\n",
      "20891\n",
      " Well this calls for an expression of gratitude.\n",
      "20892\n",
      " Ooh, am I about to get a rare Sheldon Cooper hug?\n",
      "20893\n",
      " Not this time. Then they wouldn’t be special. Thanks Penny.\n",
      "20894\n",
      " You’re welcome. Don’t worry, I didn’t forget about you. Leonard, I got you a label maker.\n",
      "20895\n",
      " Wow. No, it’s great. Also, uh, mint in box.\n",
      "20896\n",
      " Mmm. And, I got you a transporter too!\n",
      "20897\n",
      " Awesome!\n",
      "20898\n",
      " Look, it was actually designed for my vintage Mr Spock action figure.\n",
      "20899\n",
      " Oh, that’s great. Let’s open it up and put him in there.\n",
      "20900\n",

      "20901\n",
      " Oh dear Lord. No!\n",

      " C’mon can’t we just open one up and take a…\n",
      "20906\n",
      " Once you open the box it loses its value.\n",
      "20907\n",
      " Yeah, yeah, my mom gave me the same lecture about my virginity. Gotta tell you, it was a lot more fun taking it out and playing with it.\n",
      "20908\n",
      " Are you sure you want us here when you meet this woman?\n",
      "20909\n",
      " Oh yes. In my culture it’s expected to have a chaparone to oversee a first date. Plus I want to make a good impression and, no offence, but with you guys here I look like six two.\n",
      "20910\n",
      " The nuns always chaparoned the dances at my high school. They used to make us leave room between us for the holy spirit.\n",
      "20911\n",
      " Hindus do the same thing. Except they leave room for a cow.\n",
      "20912\n",

      "20913\n",

      "20914\n",

      "20915\n",
      " Well clearly you’ve never been to brunch with my cousins.\n",
      "20916\n",
      " So, arranged marriages. The parents just decide, and then you have to get married?\n",
      "20917\n",
      " Oh, no, no, I get a say in it. But I’m sure whoever shows up will be better company than a threesome I’ve been having with Aunt Jemima and Mrs Butterworth.\n",

Oh, that’s what I always thought 1975 smelled like. One to beam down Mr Scott. Aye, aye, Mr Spock. Energise. (Spins toy). Energise. (Tries to spin toy. It sticks.

      " What do you mean, she’s a lesbian?\n",
      "20960\n",
      " Well, you know whenever you and I would try to hit on women in bars, and they’d blow us off, and then we’d tell each other they were probably gay. It’s like that. Except this time it’s true.\n",
      "20961\n",
      " Then why did she even go out with you?\n",
      "20962\n",

      " Look, Howard, you’re in a relationship. You know you have to make compromises.\n",
      "20965\n",

      "20966\n",
      " It’s a great deal. We both get our parents off our backs. I don’t have to come home to an empty apartment every night, plus, once I’m married, I can finally eat carbs again and let myself go.\n",
      "20967\n",
      " Why don’t you tell your parents you want to try and find someone else, you know, maybe one who hasn’t slept with more women than you.\n",
      "20968\n",
      " Because this one wants to marry me. I might never find another one who does.\n",
      "20969\n",
      " So you’re seriously thinking about marrying someone you’re never going to have sex with.\n",
      "20970\n",
      " I can’t believe your attitude. I thought you were in favour of gay people getting married.\n",

      " Yes, to other gay people.\n",
      "20972\n",
      " Do you hear how homophobic you sound?\n",
      "20973\n",

      " What?\n",
      "20975\n",
      " Nothing. I said nothing.\n",

      "20980\n",

      "20982\n",
      " What is your problem?\n",
      "20983\n",
      " My problem is that I don’t want you to break Leonard’s toy, which you probably did by shaking it. She shook it. We all saw her.\n",
      "20984\n",
      " Leonard, I bought you this because I wanted you to have fun with it. I don’t want it to just sit in this box.\n",
      "20985\n",
      " You know, you’re right. I mean, it’s from you, I’m never going to sell it. I’m opening it.\n",

      " Yes.\n",
      "20987\n",

      "20992\n",
      " Yes. Yes, he did, that is a perfectly satisfying and plausible explanation. Yeah, let’s all be mad at Stuart.\n",
      "20993\n",
      " You know, I paid a lot for this. Let’s take it over there and show him.\n",
      "20994\n",

      " Why would you open mine?\n",
      "20997\n",

      " Well, you should talk to Stuart.\n",
      "20999\n",

      "21001\n",

      "21006\n",
      " Yes.\n",

      "21030\n",
      " Oh, boy, Sheldon’s going to freak out.\n",
      "21031\n",
      " Yeah, he worships Hawking.\n",
      "21032\n",
      " I was actually thinking about bringing him along when I go over there so he can meet the great man.\n",
      "21033\n",

      "21034\n",
      " Hm, it’s no big deal.\n",
      "21035\n",
      " Boy, a restraining order from Stephen Hawking. It’ll look so nice next to the ones he’s already got from Leonard Nimoy, Carl Sagan and Stan Lee.\n",
      "21036\n",
      " Leonard, do you recall when I said that I was going to revolutionize humanity’s understanding of the Higgs boson particle, and you said, Sheldon, it’s two a.m., get out of my bedroom?\n",
      "21037\n",
      " Like it was ten hours ago. What about it?\n",
      "21038\n",
      " Well, I believe I’ve done it. And I’m only saying believe to sound modest, because, sweet Sam Houston, I did it.\n",
      "21039\n",
      " Really?\n",
      "21040\n",
      " That’s incredible. Oh, here, break out the math.\n",
      "21041\n",
      " Oh, okay, let me see this. All right, so this particle here is the boson moving forward in time. Now, I was thinking… Howard, you go ahead and eat. This isn’t going to make any sense to you.\n"

      " Yeah, yeah, I know, he’s the wheelchair dude who invented time.\n",
      "21137\n",
      " That’s close enough.\n",
      "21138\n",
      " I don’t understand, why doesn’t Howard just introduce you to the guy?\n",
      "21139\n",
      " Because he’s punishing me for being a, quote, condescending jerk. You don’t think I’m condescending, do you?\n",
      "21140\n",
      " Well…\n",
      "21141\n",
      " Oh, I’m sorry, condescending means…\n",
      "21142\n",
      " I know what it means. And yes, you love correcting people and putting them down.\n",
      "21143\n",
      " Au contraire. When I correct people I am raising them up. You should know, I do it for you more than anyone.\n",
      "21144\n",
      " Come on, you do it to feel superior. I see that twinkle in your eye when someone says who instead of whom or thinks the moon is a planet.\n",

      "21154\n",
      " It’s not her fault. She’s getting hormone replacement therapy. Makes her crazy horny. Check this out, I got Sheldon to wear the French maid’s costume.\n",
      "21155\n",
      " Oh, my God, that’s terrible.\n",
      "21156\n",

      " Why are you doing that? You’re being mean to him.\n",

      "21161\n",
      " It’s not the same thing. Sheldon doesn’t know when he’s being mean because the part of his brain that should know is getting a wedgie from the rest of his brain.\n",
      "21162\n",
      " Fine, I’ll just make him do a couple more things, then I’ll stop.\n",
      "21163\n",
      " No, you have to stop now.\n",
      "21164\n",

      " It’s nicer than anything he’s ever said to me. I’d take it and run.\n",
      "21187\n",
      " Thank you, Sheldon.\n",
      "21188\n",
      " Now will you give my paper to Hawking?\n",
      "21189\n",
      " Sorry, I can’t.\n",
      "21190\n",
      " What, why not?\n",
      "21191\n",
      " I gave it to him three days ago. He was really impressed. He wants to meet you.\n",
      "21192\n",
      " All right, then. Thank you, Howard. Please let Professor Hawking know that I’m available at his earliest convenience.\n",
      "21193\n",
      " I thought he might be a little more excited.\n",
      "21194\n",
      " Give it a second. (Sound of Sheldon shrieking in joy in his bedroom)\n",
      "21195\n",
      " Professor Hawking, it’s an honour and a privilege to meet you, sir.\n",
      "21196\n",
      " I want to thank you for taking time to see me.\n",
      "21197\n",
      " I know.\n",
      "21198\n",
      " Thank you. It just, it came to me one morning in the shower.\n",
      "21199\n",
      " What do you mean wrong?\n",
      "21200\n",
      " No, no, th-th-th-that can’t be right. I-I don’t make arithmetic mistakes.\n",
      "21201\n",
      " Oh, no, no, no, of course not. It’s just, I was thinking… Oh, gosh, golly, I made a boo-boo, and I gave it to Stephen Hawking.\n",
      "21202\n",
      " I wish you could all be inside my head. The conversation is sparkling. (Pause) Fine, I’ll tell you. A lichen is an organism made up of two separate species, fungi and algae. If you could merge with another species, what species would you pick and why? Hint, there is a right answer. None of you will get it.\n",
      "21203\n",
      " Okay, uh, I’d pick swan because, uh, the resulting hybrid would have the advanced industrial civilization of a human and the long graceful neck I’ve always dreamed of having.\n",
      "21204\n",
      " Wrong. Leonard?\n",
      "21205\n",
      " Horse, but mostly just for the height. A little bit for the genital girth.\n",
      "21206\n",
      " Wrong, and let’s keep it clean, shall we?\n",
      "21207\n",
      " Kangaroo, uh, I’d be a Kanga-Jew. The first of my people to dunk a basketball.\n",
      "21208\n",
      " Also instead of just living in your mother’s house, you could actually live inside her body.\n",
      "21209\n",
      " Clever, but also wrong. No, the best organism for human beings to merge with is the lichen itself. That way, you’d be human, fungus, and algae. Triple threat. Like three-bean salad.\n",
      "21210\n",
      " Give me one circumstance in which that would be useful.\n",
      "21211\n",
      " All right, picture this, a beautiful outdoor concert. Now, as a human, I appreciate Beethoven. As a fungus, I have a terrific view, growing out of a towering maple tree. And no thank you, expensive concessions. Because as an algae, I’ll just snack on this sunlight.\n",
      "21212\n",
      " He got us again.\n",
      "21213\n",
      " No, he didn’t.\n",
      "21214\n",
      " Anyway, if it’s okay with you, we should talk about Howard’s bachelor party.\n",
      "21215\n",
      " Well, seems like a bit of a let down after our lichen conversation, but, what do you know, you’re half swan.\n",
      "21216\n",
      " I’ve been doing some research on strippers. One agency I spoke to, said I could get us a great price if we’re flexible on age range and number of limbs.\n",
      "21217\n",
      " Sounds like loads of fun, but I promised Bernadette no strippers.\n",
      "21218\n",
      " You don’t want strippers? You’re the king of strippers. The one club in North Hollywood named a pole after you.\n",
      "21219\n",
      " What can I tell ya, I’m not into that stuff any more.\n",
      "21220\n",
      " Good for you, Howard. I’m proud of you. And still, you’re the first one of us to get married. We have to do something special.\n",
      "21221\n",
      " You know Germans have an interesting pre-wedding custom.\n",
      "21222\n",
      " Well, it’s probably not for me.\n",
      "21223\n",
      " Maybe we can go up to Napa Valley. They’ve got that wine train.\n",
      "21224\n",
      " Boo, wine! But yay, trains. I’m in.\n",
      "21225\n",
      " Anyway, it’s a beautiful time of year. Uh, you travel through the vineyards. There’s a tasting on board. And all the wild flowers are in bloom. It’s magic.\n",
      "21226\n",
      " Look at that, in 30 seconds, we went from hiring women to being them.\n",
      "21227\n",
      " So, I hear you and the lost boys are having a bachelor party tonight.\n",
      "21228\n",
      " Yeah, just going to a restaurant, get some steaks and scotch. Nothing to worry about.\n",
      "21229\n",
      " Why should I worry?\n",
      "21230\n",
      " Well, I don’t know. It’s a bachelor party. There could be strippers. Wouldn’t that make you a little jealous?\n",
      "21231\n",
      " Oh, come on Leonard, it’s you. What’s going to happen? I mean, even if there was a stripper, all you’d do is avoid eye-contact and maybe offer to help her kid with his homework.\n",
      "21232\n",
      " Hey, I am a young man in his sexual prime. Under the right conditions, I-I-I am capable of just, really crazy stuff.\n",
      "21233\n",
      " Really? What is the craziest thing you’ve ever done with a woman? And the time you and I had sex in the ocean does not count.\n",
      "21234\n",
      " Oh, come on, that’s got to count. There was a really strong undertow, we could have died.\n",
      "21235\n",
      " Well, have fun tonight.\n",
      "21236\n",
      " Oh, I will. There is no telling what might happen.\n",
      "21237\n",
      " Yeah, there is.\n",
      "21238\n",
      " You know, there’s nothing wrong helping some woman’s kid get through their S.A.T.’s.\n",
      "21239\n",
      " Hey, I got to hand it to Raj, he found a really nice spot to have a bachelor party.\n",
      "21240\n",
      " It’s not bad. Unless you compare it to a train; then it stinks.\n",
      "21241\n",
      " Are you drinking whisky?\n",
      "21242\n",
      " Indeed. If I’m to participate in the social convention that is the stag night, then I must embrace all its components, including tobacco, swear words, and yes, alcohol. Jeepers! That’s yucky.\n",
      "21243\n",
      " Whoa, it’s a little early to start dropping J-bombs, don’t you think?\n",
      "21244\n",
      " Oh, hey, Wil. Nice of you to make it out tonight for Howard.\n",
      "21245\n",
      " I’m confused. I thought since our reconciliation, I was your friend in this group.\n",
      "21246\n",
      " Oh. I guess you’re just friends with anybody. (Drinks) Aagh!\n",
      "21247\n",
      " Oh, yeah, no worries.\n",
      "21248\n",
      " Oh, all right.\n",
      "21249\n",
      " Yeah, sure.\n",
      "21250\n",
      " Oh.\n",
      "21251\n",
      " Wow, that’s very nice.\n",
      "21252\n",
      " Hey, everybody! The bachelor boy has arrived! For he’s a jolly good fellow…\n",
      "21253\n",
      " Actually, Barry, we’re not going to have strippers tonight.\n",
      "21254\n",
      " Um, these are gift bags we’re going to put in the hotel rooms of our out-of-town guests. This is a map of Pasadena. This is a list of local restaurants. And then, for Howie’s relatives, we have antihistamines, antacids, and medicine for diarrhoea and constipation.\n",
      "21255\n",
      " Yeah, we labeled them stop and go.\n",
      "21256\n",
      " All right, pivoting to the big question. Bernadette, on your wedding night you’ll be consummating your marriage. What do you think your first sexual position will be as husband and wife?\n",
      "21257\n",
      " Amy, please.\n",
      "21258\n",
      " Keeping in mind that whoever’s on top may set the tone for the marriage.\n",
      "21259\n",
      " Okay, show’s over.\n",
      "21260\n",
      " Hey, they may conceive a child on their wedding night. Don’t you think the kid might get a kick out of knowing how it happened?\n",
      "21261\n",
      " I don’t care. Ask her things like are you going to take Howard’s name? Not who’s going to sit on who?\n",
      "21262\n",
      " I’ve actually been thinking I’m going to hyphenate: Bernadette Mary-Ann Rostenkowski-Wolowitz.\n",
      "21263\n",
      " Nice. You know, you should totally get BernadetteMaryAnnRostenkowskiWolowitz.com before someone snaps it up.\n",
      "21264\n",
      " Howard already took care of it. Plus, he set up our beautiful wedding website with cute little facts about our family histories. Do you know, for a while in Poland, my family and his family were neighbours.\n",
      "21265\n",
      " Oh, that’s cool.\n",
      "21266\n",
      " No, it’s not. I’ll explain it to you later.\n",
      "21267\n",
      " May I have your attention, please? We are hear tonight to celebrate the upcoming nuptials of my best friend Howard Wolowitz.\n",
      "21268\n",
      " And, apparently, Wil Wheaton’s best friend.\n",
      "21269\n",
      " Talk to the hand.\n",
      "21270\n",
      " Does anyone have any words they’d like to say about our man of the evening?\n",
      "21271\n",
      " Yeah, I do. (All groan). As is the tradition, I have prepared a series of disrespectful jokes which generate humour at Howard’s expense. Prepare to have your ribs tickled. Howard, I always thought you’d be the last one of us to ever get married, because you are so short and unappealing. Am I right? Let’s see here. Oh, seriously though, Howard, you’re actually one of the most intelligent people I know. And that’s a zinger, because you’re not. I’ve always thought that you’d make someone a fine husband someday. Assuming you’d be able to get the parts, and develop the engineering skills to assemble them, which I don’t see as likely. Hacha! Okay, let me see here. Okay, kidding aside, Howard, you are a good friend. And I wish you nothing but happiness. Bazinga, I don’t!\n",

We were in the ocean and we started making out. I know, it was crazy. I wasn’t even wearing my Aquasocks. Then…\n",

      "21344\n",
      " Yeah, sure, I guess.\n",
      "21345\n",
      " Tell her I’m really sorry, and if she doesn’t want to marry me, I get it. But what I really want her to know is the guy that she’s disgusted by, is the guy that I’m disgusted by, too. But that guy doesn’t exist any more, he’s gone, and the reason is because of her. So, if this relationship is over, let her know that she made me a better man, and tell her thank you.\n",
      "21346\n",
      " Oh, my God, Howard. That’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever heard. And it came out of you.\n",

      "21472\n",

      " No. I, uh, I should talk to him, man to man.\n",
      "21481\n",
      " But, Howie, my dad can be a bully. He’s gonna make you cancel your space flight.\n",

      "21543\n",

      " I changed my mind. I don’t want to do this.\n",
      "21548\n",
      " Yeah, I’m a funny guy. I also have a hysterical bit planned for later where I pretend to cry through the whole launch.\n",

      " Sheldon, what channel is NASA TV?\n",
      "21550\n",
      " 289, right between the Game Show Network at 288 and the East coast feed of the Disney Channel on 290.\n",

      " I love his eidetic memory, it’s so sexy. Sheldon, what are the ingredients in Pringles?\n",

      " Dried potatoes, vegetable oil, corn flower, wheat starch, maltodextrin, salt, and my favourite ingredient of all, uniformity.\n",

      " The uterus quivers, does it not?\n",
      "21554\n",
      " There’s Howard’s rocket, live from Kazakhstan.\n",

      "21556\n",
      " You’re nervous? I’ve been stress-eating for four days. Look at me. I’m wearing my fat pants.\n",
      "21557\n",
      " Remarkable. In just under a half hour, 200 metric tons of fuel will ignite in a controlled explosion right beneath Howard’s keister. And all from a country whose entire contribution to the global economy, has been Tetris and mail-order brides.\n",
      "21558\n",
      " Give me those damn Pringles.\n",
      "21559\n",
      " Good! Good! Oh, quick question, I missed it in the briefing. How much urine do these suits hold?\n",
      "21560\n",
      " Check.\n",
      "21561\n",
      " No, it’s ’cause I live with my mom and she makes me Froot Loops.\n",
      "21562\n",
      " Thanks, we decided to do it before the launch.\n",
      "21563\n",
      " Not exactly. Listen, if you don’t mind, I’m not really up for chatting. I’m just going to sit here quietly and let my life flash before my eyes. That went really quick. Let me try it again.\n",
      "21564\n",
      " Close your eyes. Put out your hand. I got you something special.\n",
      "21565\n",

      "21566\n",
      " No, here.\n",
      "21567\n",
      " Oh, Howie. A little star, it’s beautiful. Put it on me.\n",
      "21568\n",
      " Okay, but I’m going to have to get it back from you so I can take it to the International Space Station. That way, when I come home, you will have a star that was actually in space.\n",
      "21569\n",
      " Oh, my God.\n",
      "21570\n",
      " Take that, every guy who’s ever bought you anything.\n",

      " This is the most amazing gift I’ve ever gotten.\n",

      "21575\n",
      " What?\n",
      "21576\n",
      " I want to be married to you before you get in that rocket.\n",
      "21577\n",
      " But I’m leaving in two days.\n",
      "21578\n",
      " I don’t need to take cereal.\n",
      "21579\n",
      " They invented blintzes. I’ll be fine.\n",
      "21580\n",
      " We’ll have a quick little ceremony with just our friends, and we’ll still have the big reception with everyone when you get back.\n",
      "21581\n",
      " Wow. Okay. Let’s get married.\n",
      "21582\n",
      " So anyway, we decided to go down to City Hall this afternoon get married, and then have the reception when Howard gets back.\n",
      "21583\n",
      " That’s so great. (Others also make encouraging sounds)\n",
      "21584\n",
      " I mean, we know it’s short notice, but we’d love you all to come with us.\n",
      "21585\n",
      " No, no, no, this is not the wedding I wanted! I want to wear my maid of honour dress and walk down the aisle with a hundred eyes on me, while a string quartet plays The Way You Look Tonight.\n",
      "21586\n",
      " That wasn’t going to be our processional music.\n",
      "21587\n",
      " Well, it was going to be mine.\n",
      "21588\n",
      " Thank you for the invitation, but I have to decline because it doesn’t sound like something I’ll enjoy.\n",
      "21589\n",
      " Come on, Sheldon, it’ll be fun.\n",
      "21590\n",
      " That’s what you said about The Green Lantern movie. You were 114 minutes of wrong.\n",
      "21591\n",
      " So, what do you say, Amy?\n",
      "21592\n",
      " Can I wear my maid of honour dress?\n",
      "21593\n",
      " Seriously? You’re going to wear that thing to City Hall?\n",
      "21594\n",
      " It’s all I have left. You’re going to take that from me, too?\n",

      "21599\n",
      " Look at all these people in love. It kind of gets you thinking, doesn’t it?\n",
      "21600\n",
      " It does, indeed. Leonard, is it awkward being here with Penny given that you recently proposed to her?\n",
      "21601\n",
      " You proposed to Penny?\n",
      "21602\n",

      "21613\n",
      " All right, that’s enough. Today is not about you two. Today is about Howard and Bernadette and me.\n",

      " Oh, no.\n",
      "21615\n",
      " I got this. Excuse me, but is there any way you could squeeze us in? See, I’m an astronaut and I’m leaving for Russia on Sunday so I can take a Soyuz rocket to the International Space Station.\n",

      " Okay, hold on…\n",
      "21838\n",
      " Now, don’t blame yourself. He was a groveller from way back. But the point is, the two of you got past it. And, Leonard, you go and propose to this poor girl in the middle of sex? That was some weak tea, dude.\n",

      " Raj.\n",
      "21847\n",

      "21969\n",
      " String theory is complicated. That’s just yucky. Don’t get any ideas. All right, for the sake of argument, let’s say that’s true. Why doesn’t Penny just end the relationship?\n",

      " She’s not sure how she feels.\n",
      "21971\n",
      " How can she not be sure how she feels? You know, when I have a feeling, I know it. Trains? Love them. Swordfish? I love them, too. They’re fish with a sword for a nose.\n",
      "21972\n",
      " Regardless, don’t say anything to Leonard.\n",
      "21973\n",

      "21975\n",

You know, like, uh, a semi truck might be an alien robot, or, uh, someone in a romantic relationship, uh, might feel differently than they appear to. Or a conversation about The Transformers might actually be about someone in this room. I’m going to pause to let that sink in.\n",

      " Well, of course he’s desirable. I mean, he’s great. He’s smart, he’s sweet, and, ooh, in the bedroom, whew, let me tell you, he really tries.\n",
      "22236\n",
      " So it does bother you.\n",
      "22237\n",
      " Fine, it bothers me a little. No. You know what? This is stupid. It doesn’t bother me. Okay, it bothers me. But only because she wouldn’t stop laughing. Leonard is not that funny.\n",
      "22238\n",
      " And there you have it, prefrontal cortex reasoning versus limbic lust. If this were a boxing match, they might call it the thrilla adjacent to the amygdala. If you were a brain scientist, you would be busting a gut right now.\n",

      " I’ll be right back. Feel free to play with yourself.\n",
      "22861\n",
      " I don’t care for your friend, he’s being rude to me. You need to ask him to leave.\n",
      "22862\n",
      " Amy, I can’t just ask Wil Wheaton to leave. He’s a minor celebrity. Once you explain who he is, many people recognize him.\n",
      "22863\n",
      " Fine. Then maybe I should go.\n",
      "22864\n",
      " Could you? That would solve everything. You are the best. I’ll see you at dinner tonight?\n",
      "22865\n",

      " Come to think of it, I would! You, little lady, are on fire.\n",
      "22867\n",
      " Every time we eat dinner here, your mother refuses to let me help with the dishes.\n",
      "22868\n",
      " Don’t take it personally. She likes doing them by herself so she can lick the plates with no one looking.\n",
      "22869\n",
      " You ready to go?\n",
      "22870\n",
      " Yeah, let me just grab a couple of fresh turtlenecks.\n",
      "22871\n",
      " I don’t understand why you keep your stuff here when there’s plenty of room at home.\n",
      "22872\n",
      " What are you talking about? All I have here is a few sweaters, books, bank stuff, computers, mail, collectibles, medicine and my electric body groomer. Ooh, there’s my plaid dickie. Oh, got this at the Goodwill store for 50 cents. Can you believe it?\n",
      "22873\n",
      " 50 cents sounds right. Let’s go.\n",
      "22874\n",
      " You know, it’s kinda late. Why don’t we just spend the night here?\n",
      "22875\n",
      " Because we don’t live here.\n",
      "22876\n",
      " I know.\n",
      "22877\n",
      " Do you? You said when you got back from space you were gonna move into my apartment, but half the time we stay here.\n",
      "22878\n",
      " That’s not true.\n",
      "22879\n",
      " There’s some underwear in the hamper.\n",
      "22880\n",
      " Thank you, I only put it on the list two weeks ago. Okay, I see what you’re getting at. How about this weekend I’ll box up all my things and move them to our place.\n",
      "22881\n",
      " Thank you.\n",
      "22882\n",
      " The lightsabres are gonna look great in the living room.\n",
      "22883\n",
      " Or in the closet. We can decide later.\n",
      "22884\n",
      " Let go of whatever piece of food you’re holding.\n",
      "22885\n",
      " Hey, look who’s out after dark, like a big boy.\n",
      "22886\n",
      " I was out raising heck with Mr. Wil Wheaton. Four hours more and we would have closed down the HomeTown Buffet.\n",
      "22887\n",
      " I thought you had plans with Amy.\n",
      "22888\n",
      " Yeah, I did, but then Wil called Amy a pain in the A-S-S. She got huffy and left, then Wil and I headed out to dinner. That place really did remind me of my hometown. Because there we also have a HomeTown Buffet.\n",
      "22889\n",
      " Hold on. Wil and Amy had an argument?\n",
      "22890\n",
      " Yes, quite the kerfuffle.\n",
      "22891\n",
      " Then Amy got mad and left?\n",
      "22892\n",
      " Walked right out the door.\n",
      "22893\n",
      " And you?\n",
      "22894\n",
      " Enjoyed a delightful dinner at a reasonable price. The manager recognized Wil and let us sit right next to the frozen yoghurt machine. Right next to it. I was closer to it than I am to you right now.\n",
      "22895\n",
      " Buddy, I think Amy might be upset.\n",
      "22896\n",
      " Why’s that?\n",
      "22897\n",
      " Because your friend was rude to her, and then you went to dinner with him.\n",
      "22898\n",
      " You’re just repeating what I said. It’s like living with a lactose-intolerant parrot.\n",
      "22899\n",
      " Trust me, call her.\n",
      "22900\n",
      " Fine. It’s a shame you didn’t go to dinner with us, because the buffet you’re about to enjoy only serves humble pie, a dessert much less tasty than frozen yoghurt. I was this close.\n",
      "22901\n",
      " You’ll appreciate this. Leonard has some ridiculous notion that you’re mad at me. Tell him you’re not mad at me. Go ahead, set him straight.\n",
      "22902\n",
      " I’m mad at you, Sheldon.\n",
      "22903\n",
      " Hmm. Eat one of your Luna bars. Very often when women think they’re angry, they’re really just hungry.\n",
      "22904\n",
      " I’m not hungry. Your friend insulted me, and you didn’t do anything.\n",
      "22905\n",
      " Precisely, I didn’t do anything. Now does someone feel like checking her emotional math?\n",
      "22906\n",
      " Keep going, buddy, you’re doing great.\n",
      "22907\n",
      " Sheldon, I’m your girlfriend, and you should have taken my side. That’s it. End of story. Good night.\n",
      "22908\n",
      " Wow, Amy’s mad and Leonard was right. What a weird day.\n",
      "22909\n",
      " Hey. Sorry this took so long. But you used to work here, you know how it is.\n",
      "22910\n",
      " Kitchen slammed again?\n",
      "22911\n",
      " No, I’m a terrible waitress, remember?\n",
      "22912\n",
      " So, is there anything I can do to help you with the move tomorrow?\n",
      "22913\n",
      " Now that you mention it, I was thinking tomorrow might not be great.\n",
      "22914\n",
      " What’s your excuse this time?\n",
      "22915\n",
      " No excuse. It’s just, you know, I’m Jewish, and technically, we’re not supposed to drive or carry anything on the Sabbath. So this one’s on God.\n",
      "22916\n",
      " That might be a little more convincing if you didn’t have a mouthful of bacon cheeseburger.\n",
      "22917\n",
      " My religion’s kinda loosey-goosey. Basically, as long as you got your schmekel clipped and don’t wear a cross, you’re good.\n",
      "22918\n",
      " Howie, you promised you’d move.\n",
      "22919\n",
      " And I will.\n",
      "22920\n",
      " Yeah, right.\n",
      "22921\n",
      " I will. I’m obviously not going to live in my mother’s house for the rest of my life. I’m not a child.\n",
      "22922\n",
      " I’ve seen her burp you.\n",
      "22923\n",
      " She did not burp me. She was patting me on the back, and I happened to burp. Don’t you have other tables you should be waiting on?\n",
      "22924\n",
      " Yeah, but I told you, I’m not good at my job. Bernadette, listen to me. He is never gonna leave.\n",
      "22925\n",
      " I’m starting to think you’re right.\n",
      "22926\n",
      " All right, I’ve had enough of this. I’m a grown man, I have a successful career, for the love of God, I’ve been to space. I will move out when I’m ready, and I don’t need anyone badgering me into it.\n",
      "22927\n",
      " Wow, excuse me.\n",
      "22928\n",
      " That was just for her benefit. I’ll move tomorrow. I love you. Don’t leave me.\n",
      "22929\n",
      " (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Angry Amy.\n",
      "22930\n",
      " What?\n",
      "22931\n",
      " I’ve been thinking about what happened, and I hope this gift will make things better.\n",
      "22932\n",
      " Star Trek DVDs? Why would I want this?\n",
      "22933\n",
      " First of all, you’re welcome. And furthermore, not being familiar with Wil Wheaton’s body of work, there was no way for you to know you were being rude to a national treasure. Get ready for 130 hours of I told you so. (She hands him back the DVDs and slams the door) Fine. I’ll just tell you what happens. Episode one, Encounter at Farpoint. Fade in. The new Enterprise heads out on its maiden voyage to contact the Bandi people of Deneb IV. Enter Wesley Crusher, played by my buddy… (Amy opens door, grabs DVDs, slams door again) She’s hooked.\n",
      "22934\n",
      " Wow. An end of an era.\n",
      "22935\n",
      " Boy, if these walls could talk.\n",
      "22936\n",
      " They’d say, why does he touch himself so much?\n",
      "22937\n",
      " Yeah. I can’t believe I’m not going to live here anymore. This has always been my bedroom. Right here is where my mom used to mark my height.\n",
      "22938\n",
      " Oh, yeah. Fifth grade. Sixth grade. Seventh grade. Eighth grade. Ninth grade.\n",
      "22939\n",
      " I remember when I was five, hiding under this desk with all my Halloween candy. Had some Peanut M&M’S, went into my first anaphylactic shock and had to be rushed to the hospital. Came home, celebrated with a Snickers, went into my second anaphylactic shock.\n",
      "22940\n",
      " When did you figure out you were allergic to nuts?\n",
      "22941\n",
      " Sometime around the third Almond Joy.\n",
      "22942\n",
      " Okay. You want to start loading this stuff into the truck?\n",
      "22943\n",
      " Yeah, I guess. Hey, would you do me a favour? Go on ahead. I just want one last moment alone in my old room.\n",
      "22944\n",
      " We’re not standing outside by the U-Haul while you fondle yourself.\n",
      "22945\n",

      "22948\n",
      " I had a feeling we’d have a talk like this sooner or later. Are you finally getting fuzz in weird places?\n",
      "22949\n",
      " Penny, please, I’m on the horns of a relationship dilemma. And for the record, I had a full pubis of hair by the time I was 19.\n",
      "22950\n",
      " And for the record, bleugh. So what are you drinking?\n",
      "22951\n",
      " Well, it’s been a rough day. I usually go chamomile tea, but I don’t think that’s going to cut it.\n",
      "22952\n",
      " You could have a Long Island Iced Tea.\n",
      "22953\n",
      " Will that calm my nerves?\n",
      "22954\n",
      " It’s calmed the pants off me a couple of times.\n",
      "22955\n",
      " Sold.\n",
      "22956\n",
      " Oh. So, the heart you got from the wizard giving you trouble?\n",
      "22957\n",
      " The trouble isn’t with me, Penny, it’s with your gender. Someday, scientists will discover that second X chromosome contains nothing but nonsense and twaddle.\n",
      "22958\n",
      " Yeah, Amy told me what happened. Look, just apologize. It’ll warm her twaddle.\n",
      "22959\n",
      " It’s a Band-Aid at best. See, the core problem is that Amy and Wil do not like each other. Which is baffling because they’re both crazy about me. And I like them, which indicates they’re bright and interesting and/or were on Star Trek.\n",
      "22960\n",
      " Honey, you can’t make people like each other.\n",
      "22961\n",
      " Not true. Leonard made me like you. And let me tell you, that was a hard row to hoe. Cheers, pal. Ooh. Boy, that is a treat that’s hard to beat. Get the Mad Hatter on the horn, I’m having a tea party.\n",
      "22962\n",
      " You might want to pace yourself.\n",
      "22963\n",
      " I drink tea all the time. I think I know what I’m doing.\n",
      "22964\n",

      " I don’t want another parking space. I want my parking space. It’s perfect. It’s a corner spot, cutting the risk of door-dings in half. It’s a mere 28 steps from the building entrance. The nearby tree provides shade on hot days and is also home to a delightful squirrel. Which is fortuitous because most squirrels are real jerks.\n",
      "23233\n",
      " Fun story. Meanwhile, you still don’t have a car.\n",
      "23234\n",
      " Don’t try to change the subject. This is about a parking space. It has nothing to do with cars.\n",
      "23235\n",
      " Are you listening to yourself?\n",
      "23236\n",
      " I always listen to myself. It’s one of the great joys of my life. Now, get your car out of my spot.\n",
      "23237\n",
      " Nope.\n",
      "23238\n",
      " Very well. You leave me no choice.\n",
      "23239\n",
      " What are you looking at, you stupid squirrel?\n",
      "23240\n",
      " Well, he’s not wrong. Howard did go to the International Space Station.\n",
      "23241\n",
      " Yeah, that was five weeks ago. How much longer is he gonna milk that cow?\n",
      "23242\n",
      " Sheldon, let it go. It’s not a big deal.\n",
      "23243\n",
      " No, no, this is a slippery slope, Leonard. It starts with a parking space, where does it end? It’s like my dad always said, first they say you can’t drink and drive, next thing you know, you can’t let your 10-year-old take the wheel while you sleep one off in the backseat.\n",
      "23244\n",
      " All that story does is make me feel bad for your mother.\n",
      "23245\n",
      " Leonard, you’re my best friend. Why don’t you ever take my side?\n",
      "23246\n",
      " Because I can never understand your side.\n",
      "23247\n",
      " Give it back.\n",
      "23248\n",
      " I’m sorry, but could you be more specific?\n",
      "23249\n",
      " My Iron Man helmet. Koothrappali saw you take it. Give it back.\n",
      "23250\n",
      " Oh, that. Well, see, I wanted it, and you weren’t using it. Apparently, those are the rules we live by now. Payback, it truly is the B word, isn’t it?\n",
      "23251\n",
      " Sheldon, that is a five hundred dollar limited edition collectible, and I want it back.\n",
      "23252\n",
      " I’d love to help you out, but unfortunately (puts helmet on), I’m using it.\n",
      "23253\n",
      " Fine. I’m taking your diploma.\n",
      "23254\n",
      " Go ahead. That’s the only doctorate you’ll ever get. It smells funny in here.\n",
      "23255\n",
      " We’re so proud of you, Amy. Your first bikini wax.\n",
      "23256\n",
      " Yeah. So, how you doing?\n",
      "23257\n",
      " A little sensitive, but not bad. Does it always take that long?\n",
      "23258\n",
      " Uh, no, they usually don’t have to go out and get more wax.\n",
      "23259\n",
      " I feel like I’m five pounds lighter.\n",
      "23260\n",
      " Really? Only five?\n",
      "23261\n",
      " Hey, anybody want a drink?\n",
      "23262\n",
      " Sure.\n",
      "23263\n",
      " Okay. So, did you spend last night hearing about this silly parking space fight, too?\n",
      "23264\n",
      " For hours. Fortunately, I couldn’t understand most of it ’cause Sheldon was wearing that stupid robot mask.\n",
      "23265\n",
      " Howard was so angry I had to mash up Benadryl in his ice cream to get him to fall asleep.\n",
      "23266\n",
      " I guess this is what we get for being with two testosterone-fueled alpha males. At some point, they’re bound to lock horns.\n",
      "23267\n",
      " I’m assuming these are some kind of horns they bought at Comic-Con?\n",
      "23268\n",
      " I’m really sorry they took Sheldon’s spot away. He shouldn’t have to suffer just because Howard’s such a big deal now.\n",
      "23269\n",
      " I know, Sheldon should just let Howard have his little moment in the sun.\n",
      "23270\n",
      " What’s that supposed to mean?\n",
      "23271\n",
      " Well, I mean, Howard’s never gonna go to space again, but Sheldon will always be a genius.\n",
      "23272\n",
      " You’re right. And I’m sure Sheldon will get a fancy parking spot again, if and when he makes a worthwhile contribution to science.\n",
      "23273\n",
      " If and when?\n",
      "23274\n",
      " Okay, maybe we should change the subject. Um, Amy, how are your lady parts? Still chilly down there?\n",
      "23275\n",
      " Hang on. None of Sheldon’s theories have ever been definitively proven. My husband actually went to outer space.\n",
      "23276\n",
      " That’s an impressive accomplishment. He’s now an inspiration to millions of Americans who know you don’t have to be special or even qualified to go into space.\n",
      "23277\n",
      " You know, I remember the first time I got a bikini wax. My sister did it with melted Crayolas and duct tape. It’s a bad idea.\n",
      "23278\n",
      " Gosh, Amy. I’m sensing a little hostility. Is it maybe because, like Sheldon’s work, your sex life is also theoretical?\n",
      "23279\n",
      " Damn.\n",
      "23280\n",
      " Yeah, well, at least when we do make love, Sheldon won’t be thinking about his mother. And yes, that is a cleverly veiled reference to Howard’s lifelong obsession to crawl back into her spacious womb.\n",
      "23281\n",
      " Anyway, to this day, I still can’t see a box of crayons without crossing my legs.\n",
      "23282\n",
      " I don’t have to take this. I’m gonna go home and have sex with my husband right now. Maybe I’ll let him do it to me in the parking spot. Which sounds dirty, but I didn’t mean it that way,\n",
      "23283\n",
      " Okay, here’s another one: If a zombie bites a vampire, and the vampire bites a human, does the human become a vampire or a zombie? Or a zompire?\n",
      "23284\n",
      " Sheldon?\n",
      "23285\n",
      " Cookie.\n",
      "23286\n",
      " I don’t have any.\n",
      "23287\n",
      " Well, I’m not giving it away. (Enters apartment. Howard is sitting naked in his spot with a laptop on his lap)\n",
      "23288\n",
      " Hi Sheldon.\n",
      "23289\n",
      " He’s in my spot. Leonard, make him stop being naked in my spot.\n",
      "23290\n",
      " Howard, what are you doing?\n",
      "23291\n",
      " He wasn’t using it. And I needed a nice cool piece of leather to wiggle my naked ass on.\n",
      "23292\n",
      " Get off there.\n",
      "23293\n",
      " Give me back my Iron Man helmet.\n",
      "23294\n",
      " Give me back my parking space.\n",
      "23295\n",
      " You don’t need a parking space. You don’t have a car.\n",
      "23296\n",
      " You don’t need an Iron Man helmet. You’re not Iron Man.\n",
      "23297\n",
      " Well, we appear to have reached an impasse. And you know, I have to say, I thought you’d be more upset that your laptop is sitting on my junk.\n",
      "23298\n",
      " I didn’t pick up on that. That’s a nice touch.\n",
      "23299\n",
      " Mmm.\n",
      "23300\n",
      " This is so exciting. I’m feeling all tingly. Although that could just be my newly defoliated bikini zone.\n",

      " Keep a lookout. This place is swarming with campus security. They will not hesitate to scold us.\n",
      "23302\n",
      " Freaking pigs.\n",
      "23303\n",
      " Oh, yeah. Okay, now, pull your car into the spot and let’s get out of here.\n",
      "23304\n",
      " Wait, I’m leaving my car here?\n",
      "23305\n",
      " Yes, and be sure and put on the emergency brake. Really makes these things tough to budge.\n",
      "23306\n",
      " Before I park, come in the back seat. I want to show you something I had done today.\n",
      "23307\n",

      "23308\n",
      " What do you think?\n",
      "23309\n",
      " I think you’re high on paint fumes. And boy, that’s a lot of Band-Aids.\n",
      "23310\n",
      " Okay, Howard’s mother is in, like, every one of your wedding photos.\n",
      "23311\n",
      " What can I tell ya? She’s a big girl. Wherever you look, there she is. More coffee?\n",
      "23312\n",
      " No, Leonard’s taking me to a physics lecture, and coffee’ll just keep me awake. (Knock on door) Oh, I’ll get it.\n",

      " Oh, looks like someone’s on Team Bernadette. Where’s Howard?\n",
      "23314\n",
      " He’s not here. What’s wrong?\n",
      "23315\n",

      "23638\n",

      " Nines or tens?\n",

      "23642\n",
      " In a New Delhi minute.\n",
      "23643\n",

      "23646\n",
      " Yeah, sorry. Uh, you come to the end of the tunnel and find a large chest. What do you do? And, Howard, do not say, I feel up the large chest.\n",
      "23647\n",
      " Excuse me, I’m a married man now. I wasn’t going to say anything so juvenile.\n",
      "23648\n",
      " Great. What do you do?\n",
      "23649\n",
      " I walk up to the large chest, bury my face in it and go “blublublublublublublublu”\n",
      "23650\n",
      " I open the chest.\n",
      "23651\n",
      " It’s locked, but suddenly the door behind you slams shut and now the walls of the room start closing in.\n",
      "23652\n",

      " Who the hell is Svaty Vaclav?\n",
      "23654\n",
      " Walls are getting closer.\n",
      "23655\n",

      " You’re ten seconds away from getting crushed. Nine, eight.\n",
      "23657\n",

      "23658\n",
      " Seven, six.\n",
      "23659\n",
      " Wait, wait. Svaty Vaclav is better known as Good King Wenceslas from the beloved Victorian Christmas carol.\n",
      "23660\n",
      " Never heard of it. Must be the one Christmas song not written by a Jewish guy.\n",
      "23661\n",
      " Three, two.\n",
      "23662\n",
      " Good King Wenceslas looked out, on the feast of Stephen. When the snow lay ’round about, deep and crisp and even\n",

      "23664\n",

      "23665\n",
      "The walls stop. You’re safe.\n",
      "23666\n",
      " That was amazing, Sheldon.\n",
      "23667\n",
      " It was simple. I combined a well-known historical fact about Bohemia with the memory of my grandparents, Mee-Maw and Pop-Pop, singing Christmas carols while I sat in front of the fire and tried to build a high-energy particle accelerator out of Legos.\n",
      "23668\n",
      " Okay, continuing our quest.\n",
      "23669\n",
      " W-W-Wait. There’s still four more verses. You don’t sing a song and not finish it. Hither, page, and stand by me, if thou know’st it, telling. Yonder peasant, who is he? Where and what his dwelling? Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost…\n"

      " Yes, we found Santa. Christmas is saved. Don’t ever tell my mother I said that.\n",

      "23742\n",
      " Wait, what are you doing?\n",
      "23743\n",
      " You can’t talk, you’re paralyzed. I get right up in Santa’s big, fat face and say, well, well, well, jolly old Saint Nick, we meet again. Yeah, I believe the last time we spoke was in the Baybrook Mall in Galveston, Texas, when I was five years old, isn’t that right?\n",
      "23744\n",
      " Uh, okay.\n",
      "23745\n",
      " My mother dragged me there and she plopped me down on your lap and you asked me what I wanted for Christmas. And I told you, my Pop-Pop, because that was the year my grandfather died. I missed him and I wanted him back.\n",

      " This is weird, right?\n",
      "23747\n",
      " Pop-Pop was the only one in my family who encouraged me to pursue science. But you didn’t bring him back, did you? No, instead, I got Lincoln Logs. Well, you can build a lot of neat things out of Lincoln Logs, but Pop-Pop ain’t one of ’em. And now you’re here asking me for something, to save you. Well, sorry, Mr. Kringle, but today’s not your day. I’m leaving you here to rot, and I hope the ogres feast on your bones. I take the skeleton key, and I toss it into the chasm, and on the way out, I give Santa a swift kick in his bowl full of jelly!\n",
      "23748\n",
      " Okay. So Wolowitz and Stuart are paralyzed, Santa’s dead, and I picked this over having sex with my girlfriend.\n",

      "23756\n",
      " Well, I must say, Leonard, when I first heard your idea for Giant Jenga, I was sceptical.\n",
      "23757\n",
      " I can’t blame you. Tiny Twister was a complete bust.\n",
      "23758\n",
      " No, I was wrong. The looming threat of being crushed under a pile of lumber does add a certain spice. I’ve never felt so alive. (Answers door) Oh, hello, Alex. Uh, let me go get you last night’s recordings.\n",

      " What recordings?\n",
      "23760\n",
      " Well, you remember when you told me I talk in my sleep? Well, it occurred to me that, like most things I say, it’s probably pure gold. So I started recording it all, and now Alex gets to comb through eight hours of what I like to call Sheldon After Dark.\n",
      "23761\n",

      "23762\n",
      " Well, most of Saturday’s gonna be figuring out where to put this game when we’re done. How about you?\n",
      "23763\n",
      " Ooh. That’s his take on John Wheeler’s quantum foam. That should be great.\n",
      "23764\n",
      " Ah, I’d love to, but I’m supposed to hang out with Penny.\n",
      "23765\n",

      "23768\n",
      " I did the research. Tony the Tiger, Dig’em the Frog, Cap’n Crunch, Toucan Sam, Count Chocula, Trix the Rabbit, Snap, Crackle and Pop. Not one cereal mascot is a girl. It’s a total breakfast sausage fest.\n",
      "23769\n",

      "23770\n",
      " Almost. Franken Berry, Boo Berry, Sugar Bear and the Honey Nut Cheerio bee, I believe his name is Buzz.\n",

      " I talk with my eyes.\n",
      "23777\n",
      " You look like my little cousin when he’s dropping one in his diaper.\n",
      "23778\n",
      " She knows I have a girlfriend. It’s so weird.\n",
      "23779\n",
      " Oh, my God. You’re loving this.\n",
      "23780\n",
      " To my bones. I mean, I’m not gonna do anything about it. I love Penny. It’s just nice to have a young, attractive woman sniffing around the goods.\n",
      "23781\n",
      " I both hate you and want to be you. This is Ryan Gosling all over again.\n",
      "23782\n",
      " Ah, gentlemen, what is on the conversational menu this morning?\n",
      "23783\n",
      " Leonard stole my woman, and he knew full well I was only six to eight months away from making my move.\n",
      "23784\n",
      " I didn’t steal anyone.\n",
      "23785\n",
      " Your assistant is totally hitting on this jerk and he loves it.\n",
      "23786\n",
      " Well, that’s not acceptable. I mean, I’m her boss. She needs to be solely focused on my needs, not distracted by your pasty, androgynous brand of sexuality.\n",
      "23787\n",
      " I’m androgynous?\n",
      "23788\n",
      " Oh, please. Look at you with your pouty bee-stung lips.\n",
      "23789\n",
      " What do you guys think I should do?\n",
      "23790\n",
      " I say you tell Alex your heart belongs to Penny, I provide her a shoulder to cry on, and then roughly half a year later I give it to her good.\n",
      "23791\n",
      " I want to thank you all for coming on such short notice. Uh, in the past, I’ve reached out to each of you individually, but I believe my present situation requires the collective wisdom of the group, which as you can see from your commemorative T-shirts I have dubbed Sheldon Cooper’s Council of Ladies.\n",
      "23792\n",
      " What is happening?\n",
      "23793\n",
      " I need your advice about a delicate workplace situation. Uh, to protect those involved, I’ll be changing their names.\n",
      "23794\n",
      " Who’s involved?\n",
      "23795\n",
      " Well, a short, bespectacled colleague of mine who lives in the shadow of his brilliant roommate. Let’s call this colleague Ricardo Shilly-Shally.\n",
      "23796\n",
      " You’re talking about Leonard.\n",
      "23797\n",
      " No, no, Shilly-Shally has red hair and, uh, he briefly served in the Mexican Navy. Anyway, despite the fact that he has a girlfriend, Shilly-Shally has been the recipient of inappropriate workplace flirtations from a young lady.\n",
      "23798\n",
      " It’s your assistant Alex, isn’t it?\n",
      "23799\n",
      " No. No. No. This is Tondelaya della Ventimiglia.\n",
      "23800\n",
      " Wait, what the hell’s going on with Leonard and Alex?\n",
      "23801\n",
      " No, uh, no, I’m sorry. Who’s talking about Leonard and Alex?\n",
      "23802\n",
      " Fine. Ricardo and Tondelaya.\n",
      "23803\n",
      " Okay, look, it’s not really about Ricardo and Tondelaya. It is really about her boss, who doesn’t quite know how to handle this situation and could use your advice, which is surprising because Dr. Einstein Von Brainstorm, he’s usually pretty smart about these things.\n",
      "23804\n",
      " I’m gonna kill her.\n",
      "23805\n",
      " I’m sure you’ve got nothing to worry about. Leonard would never cheat on you.\n",
      "23806\n",
      " She’s right. But say the word, I got a lab full of cocaine-addicted monkeys with nothing to lose. One of them could end up in the backseat of her car. Or her shower.\n",
      "23807\n",
      " Ladies, ladies, please. We’re not here to talk about Penny, okay? We’re here to talk about me. Uh, I mean Einstein Von Brainstorm. Oh, darn it! All right, I guess the cat’s out of the bag. Let me explain what’s going on. Ricardo is really Leonard.\n",
      "23808\n",
      " We know what’s going on, Sheldon!\n",
      "23809\n",
      " Well, what should I do?\n",
      "23810\n",
      " Well, Alex is your employee. If she’s doing something that’s making Leonard uncomfortable, you should talk to her.\n",
      "23811\n",
      " Oh, no, he’s not uncomfortable at all. No, he’s loving it. Yeah, he’s strutting around like he’s five-foot-six.\n",
      "23812\n",
      " What? He’s loving it?\n",
      "23813\n",
      " Sheldon, you need to talk to Alex right away.\n",
      "23814\n",
      " Talk to her? That’s all you’ve got? With a cool name like Sheldon Cooper’s Council of Ladies, I really expected more. Give me back the T-shirts.\n",
      "23815\n",
      " Alex, check my schedule. What does my afternoon look like?\n",
      "23816\n",
      " Well, that snuck up on us, didn’t it?\n",
      "23817\n",
      " Let’s not call it a problem. Let’s call it an opportunity. To solve a serious problem.\n",
      "23818\n",
      " You don’t know? Oh, you poor dear. Your ovaries are squirting so much goofy juice into your brains you don’t even know which way is up. You made an inappropriate sexual advance towards Dr. Hofstadter.\n",
      "23819\n",
      " Now, there’s no need to get defensive. I’m not unsympathetic to your plight. My father used to say that a woman is like an egg salad sandwich on a warm Texas day.\n",
      "23820\n",
      " Full of eggs and only appealing for a short time.\n",
      "23821\n",
      " Yeah, you and me both, sister. Now, please understand, I don’t hold you responsible for your behaviour because, see, from an evolutionary standpoint, you’re a slave to your desire to reproduce. But during the work day, when you feel possessed by amorous intent, may I suggest that you suppress it by leafing through this illustrated book of sexually transmitted diseases? Let’s see here. Oh, yes. Check out this oozy doozy.\n",
      "23822\n",
      " So does this fellow, but he can’t without it burning like hot soup.\n",
      "23823\n",
      " Hey, pretty lady.\n",
      "23824\n",
      " Oh, you seem extra happy.\n",
      "23825\n",
      " Uh, I guess I am.\n",
      "23826\n",
      " Any particular reason why?\n",
      "23827\n",
      " I don’t know, just having a good day. This morning Sheldon fell asleep on the way to work, so I got to listen to the radio. That was pretty crazy.\n",
      "23828\n",
      " Mm-hmm. Anything else?\n",
      "23829\n",
      " Mm. I found this quiz online called Which Star Trek Character Are You? and it only took me four tries to get Captain Kirk.\n",
      "23830\n",
      " That’s great.\n",
      "23831\n",
      " Oh. It. Was.\n",
      "23832\n",
      " Hmm. Well, I’m glad you’re having such a great day.\n",
      "23833\n",
      " Yeah. And the one thing that could make it even better is an evening with my special girl.\n",
      "23834\n",
      " Oh, and who’s that?\n",
      "23835\n",
      " What do you mean?\n",
      "23836\n",
      " Oh, I just didn’t know if you meant me or Alex.\n",
      "23837\n",
      " Um, why would I mean Alex?\n",
      "23838\n",
      " Because I know she hit on you and I know you liked it.\n",
      "23839\n",
      " What?\n",
      "23840\n",
      " Don’t play dumb with me, Ricardo Shilly-Shally!\n",
      "23841\n",
      " I’m missing something. (Enters apartment. To Sheldon) Did you say something to Penny about Alex?\n",
      "23842\n",
      " Oh, yes. Yeah, and a fat lot of good it did me. All she did was get mad at you.\n",
      "23843\n",
      " Why would you do that?\n",
      "23844\n",
      " I needed advice about a woman. I would have asked you, but if the last few years have proven anything, it’s that you can’t tell a uterus from a unicycle.\n",
      "23845\n",
      " At least I know not to blab to a girl about somebody flirting with her boyfriend.\n",
      "23846\n",
      " Good to know. Yeah, a few more helpful hints like that, you may find yourself on the Council of Ladies. (Answering phone) Hello. I see. Uh, what time? Very well, then. Huh. That was the Human Resources Department at the university. Apparently, my assistant Alex has filed a complaint accusing me of inappropriate behaviour in the workplace.\n",
      "23847\n",
      " Oh, my God, what did you do?\n",
      "23848\n",
      " Hmm, let me think. Nothing. I’m a delight.\n",
      "23849\n",
      " (Knock, knock, knock) Human Resources Department. (Knock, knock, knock) Human Resources Department. (Knock, knock, knock) Human Resources Department.\n",
      "23850\n",
      " Hello.\n",
      "23851\n",
      " Thank you.\n",
      "23852\n",
      " So I’ve been told. But I can’t understand what she has to complain about. I mean, she has a front-row seat as I make scientific history. There’s string cheese in my mini-fridge, and that’s for anyone. Yeah, and just yesterday I led her away from a life of sexual promiscuity by making her look at pictures of disease-ridden genitalia.\n",
      "23853\n",
      " Like what?\n",
      "23854\n",
      " Oh! I see the confusion here. No, no, Alex thought I was singling her out. No. I meant that all women are slaves to their biological urges, you know? Even you. You’re a slave.\n",
      "23855\n",
      " Well, y-you, I-I’m just saying, you know, at a certain point in a woman’s menstrual cycle…\n",
      "23856\n",
      " I don’t see why I’m the one being persecuted here. Dr. Hofstadter, he was bragging about his sexual desirability to anyone who would listen. You know, and Howard Wolowitz, he spent two years using university resources building a six-breasted sex robot. Oh, and at the office Christmas party, I heard Rajesh Koothrappali refer to you several times as Brown Sugar.\n",
      "23857\n",
      " Yes. No, yeah, but in his defense, that wasn’t racist. He’s also brown.\n",
      "23858\n",
      " Oh, damn it, you are.\n",
      "23859\n",
      " Please forgive me. I should have told you about Alex.\n",
      "23860\n",
      " I don’t care about Alex. Fine, I care. Okay, I hate that bitch. But what really hurt is that you liked it so much. I mean, do I need to be worried?\n",
      "23861\n",
      " Of course not. No. Why?\n",
      "23862\n",
      " Because, she is pretty and smart, and when you talk about work, she doesn’t have to go home and look up words in the dictionary to understand what you said.\n",
      "23863\n",
      " You do that?\n",
      "23864\n",
      " No.\n",
      "23865\n",
      " Hang on. Are you feeling insecure? Because that’s my thing, and if you take it away, I don’t know what I’m bringing to this relationship.\n",
      "23866\n",
      " Yes, Leonard, I am insecure. Happy?\n"

      "23894\n",
      " Relax. Everything’s gonna be fine. Before I met Bernadette I was in here every other day. Uh, little tip, turn off your I Like Big Butts ringtone before you go in.\n",
      "23895\n",
      " Well, this is all your fault.\n",

      "23907\n",
      " What are you doing here?\n",
      "23908\n",
      " Actually, I came to speak to Mrs. Davis.\n",
      "23909\n",
      " But I came to file a complaint. Somebody has made me feel uncomfortable in the workplace by using language of an inappropriate and sexual nature.\n",
      "23910\n",
      " You, you dirty birdie. I-I thought about the things you said to me yesterday, and I realized I’m deeply offended. Now, be a dear and get me one of those complaint forms.\n",
      "23911\n",
      " And thanks to you, I know better than to ask if you’re menstruating. And based on your behaviour, I don’t have to.\n",
      "23912\n",
      " It has been pointed out to me that some of the things I said to you could be construed as offensive, and I would like to offer you my sincerest apology.\n",
      "23913\n",
      " Yeah, additionally, you should know that the university has mandated that I take an online sexual harassment seminar so this sort of thing doesn’t happen in the future.\n",
      "23914\n",
      " Yeah. Now, unfortunately, uh, my time is much too valuable to waste on nonsense like this, so, um, I’m gonna need you to take it for me. Oh, and, uh, you’d better ace it, they’re pretty mad.\n",
      "23915\n",
      " So, hey, I was thinking about that stuff with Alex.\n",
      "23916\n",
      " Oh, would you stop worrying about that?\n",
      "23917\n",
      " I can’t help it. But, look, I figured I could sit around and feel insecure, or I could do something about it. So I got a course catalogue at school and looked at some of the science classes.\n",
      "23918\n",
      " That’s great.\n",
      "23919\n",
      " No, it isn’t, they are extremely boring. I mean, how do you not kill yourself, like, every day? Anyway, I decided I don’t need to be a scientist, I could just look like one. So I bought these.\n",
      "23920\n",
      " Glasses? I really don’t think that’s gonna change… oh, my God, you look so smart and hot.\n",
      "23921\n",
      " I know, right? Watch this. Molecules.\n",
      "23922\n",
      " Okay, come with me.\n",
      "23923\n",
      " Where are we going?\n",
      "23924\n",
      " To my bedroom, so I can take everything off but those glasses. And maybe the boots.\n",
      "23925\n",
      " Hey, will you steam my uniform next?\n",
      "23926\n",
      " Interesting. Do you recall this conversation? Leonard, want to go halfsies on a steamer? No, Sheldon, we don’t need a steamer. Looks like that rumpled chicken’s come home to roost.\n",
      "23927\n",
      " Hi. Here are the make-up sponges you asked for.\n",
      "23928\n",
      " Oh, thanks, I thought I had more.\n",
      "23929\n",
      " Damn, you’ve got more makeup than I do. You’ve got better makeup than I do. Yeah, I’m borrowing this.\n",
      "23930\n",
      " Hey, hey, hey, hey. This is my Comic-Con makeup. I love you, but there are some things a man doesn’t share with his girlfriend.\n",
      "23931\n",
      " That’s a wise policy. I once borrowed my sister’s makeup for a costume contest. Got a terrible case of pinkeye. But luckily, I was going as a zombie. I won second place.\n",
      "23932\n",
      " I feel like you guys just went to Comic-Con.\n",
      "23933\n",
      " That was San Diego Comic-Con. This is Bakersfield Comic-Con.\n",
      "23934\n",
      " Is that better?\n",
      "23935\n",
      " Well, it’s a lot smaller. It’s more about the comic books. The way these conventions used to be before they went all Hollywood.\n",
      "23936\n",
      " So to answer your question, no, it’s not better.\n",
      "23937\n",
      " Well, then why are you going?\n",
      "23938\n",
      " It’s a comic book convention. You know, it’s like pizza or particle accelerators, even the stinky one’s still pretty good.\n",
      "23939\n",
      " All right. Well, you guys have fun. I guess I’ll see you Sunday night.\n",
      "23940\n",
      " Yeah.\n",
      "23941\n",
      " Okay.\n",
      "23942\n",
      " Oh, hang on a second. (Hands her the day’s newspaper) Hold this. (Photographs the two of them together)\n",
      "23943\n",
      " What was that for?\n",
      "23944\n",
      " To show people when they don’t believe me.\n",
      "23945\n",
      " Oh, this is the best. You have booze with breakfast on a Tuesday, you got a problem. You do it on the weekend, you got brunch.\n",
      "23946\n",
      " Sheldon doesn’t believe in brunch. He can’t stand being at a table where one person’s having an omelette and another person’s having a sandwich.\n",
      "23947\n",
      " He’s not exhausting at all.\n",
      "23948\n",
      " It’s cute how excited they are. You should have seen Howard sewing his costume all week for the convention.\n",
      "23949\n",
      " When did Howard learn to sew?\n",
      "23950\n",
      " When he was a little boy, every couple months, he would have to let his mom’s pants out.\n",
      "23951\n",

      " Easy. His family’s loaded, and Bernadette has a great job. My wife came with both fun bags and money bags.\n",
      "24144\n",
      " Say hello to an exact scale model of me. Oh, I’m not dark chocolate. I’m melt-in-your-mouth caramel.\n",

      "24146\n",

      "24152\n",
      " I hate it when you make me sit through all the credits.\n",
      "24153\n",

      "24160\n",

      " So, cocoa?\n",
      "24164\n",

      " Oh, teacher! Me! Me!\n",
      "24166\n",

      "24168\n",

      " How do I know you’re not going to take my ideas and publish them as your own?\n",
      "24173\n",

      "24185\n",
      " I have always wanted a 3-D printer.\n",
      "24186\n",
      " Of course you have. They’re an engineer’s dream. Anything you can design, a 3-D printer can make out of plastic.\n",
      "24187\n",
      " Yeah, but they’re so expensive.\n",
      "24188\n",
      " Oh, come on. You deserve one. You’ve worked hard to find a woman who makes a lot of money.\n",
      "24189\n",
      " Well, the prices have been coming down.\n",
      "24190\n",
      " Oh, true. They’re practically giving them away. You know, in exchange for money.\n",
      "24191\n",
      " And we can make stuff we need for work with it. Prototypes of my CAD/CAM designs, specialized tools…\n",
      "24192\n",

      "24195\n",

      " I’m fine.\n",
      "24197\n",

      " Sheldon, what’s going on?\n",
      "24200\n",

      "24203\n",

      "24206\n",
      " I can’t go in today. I’m sick.\n",
      "24207\n",
      " You’re not sick. You just don’t want to face Kripke.\n",

      "24212\n",
      " Oh, dear. Now I’m not even smarter than you.\n",
      "24213\n",
      " Sheldon, Kripke’s not smarter than you. You just got stuck on a wrong path. Happened to Einstein. He got stuck on the unified field theory for decades.\n",
      "24214\n",
      " Oh, don’t play the Einstein card. His great breakthroughs happened when no one knew anything. So everything was a great breakthrough.\n",
      "24215\n",
      " Sheldon Lee Cooper, I do not have time for this nonsense. Now, go put your clothes on, get in the car, and lets go to work.\n",

      "24217\n",

      "24218\n",
      " Do you realize, by owning a 3-D printer, we are reclaiming the manufacturing process and taking jobs back from sweatshops in China?\n",
      "24219\n",

      "24220\n",
      " Eh, what can you do?\n",
      "24221\n",
      " Ooh, I, I think it’s done. Oh, it worked. We printed a whistle.\n",
      "24222\n",
      " Amazing. You realize these things go for 25 cents a pop at a party store.\n",
      "24223\n",
      " And we made it in only three hours. Sounds just like store-bought.\n",
      "24224\n",
      " Okay, give me a superhero pose, and I will scan you into the computer for your action figure.\n",
      "24225\n",

      "24228\n",
      " All right, you can suck it in a little bit.\n",

      "24234\n",
      " I’ll do what I can. But it’s not going to be easy, because when I’m with Amy and our bathing suit areas mush together, boy howdy, is it magic\n",

You push your way to the bar, where you drink an eighteen dollar cosmopolitan, then you stare at a pretty girl and imagine your perfect life together. Your children, grandchildren.

      " Okay, well, this time it’s going to be different. Because I am like a romance ninja. You don’t see it coming, and then bam, romance, watch out, hearts, kisses, love, ooh-ya!\n",
      "24523\n",
      " You know, sometimes I think I’ve made you so much cooler than you used to be, and then you go and do that.\n",

      " So, in conclusion, I believe the painful sensation felt after passing a meal of spicy chillies is proof that the rectum does possess the sense of taste.\n",
      "24525\n",
      " I concur, but you changed the subject. What are we doing for Valentine’s Day?\n",
      "24526\n",
      " Oh, you caught that, did you?\n",
      "24527\n",
      " Everything okay?\n",
      "24528\n",
      " Bernie’s a little cranky since she’s been working, like, 17 hours a day. And I’ve got a lot on my plate, too, because I’ve been busting my tail playing Assassin’s Creed.\n",
      "24529\n",
      " Hey, Stuart, you got anything going on for Valentine’s Day?\n",
      "24530\n",
      " Oh, well, I was going to spend the night with my special little lady, but, uh, she got worms, and then I had to take her to the vet.\n",
      "24531\n",
      " Well, uh, how about you keep the store open late, and we throw a party for all the people who don’t have dates?\n",
      "24532\n",
      " Yeah, the theme will be that the greatest love a man can have is the love he has with himself.\n",
      "24533\n",
      " Ah, Alex, excellent. I have a research problem that I believe you can help with.\n",
      "24534\n",
      " Oh, no, no. That’s not going to happen, no. What I need you to do is find a Valentine’s gift for my girlfriend.\n",
      "24535\n",
      " Well, I guess those chaps will have to have someone else buy their girlfriends presents. Now, here is, let’s see, this is, this is about two thousand dollars, um, I think she likes monkeys and the colour grey. Contribute to my work. Ah, kids say the darnedest things.\n",
      "24536\n",
      " Hey, you coming to lunch?\n",
      "24537\n",
      " Yeah, one second. Come here. I want to show you something.\n",
      "24538\n",
      " What you looking at?\n",
      "24539\n",
      " Well, I was trying to come up with something really romantic to give Bernadette for Valentine’s Day since she’s been such a pain in the ass.\n",
      "24540\n",
      " You can’t find a card that says that?\n",
      "24541\n",
      " Check it out. I used the atomic force microscope in the material science lab and wrote our initials in a heart one one-thousandth the size of a grain of sand.\n",
      "24542\n",
      " Oh, that’s cool.\n",
      "24543\n",
      " A micro-valentine for a microbiologist.\n",
      "24544\n",
      " From her micro-husband. That is amazing. How long did this take you?\n",
      "24545\n",
      " Mmm, about twelve hours. I pulled an all-nighter.\n",
      "24546\n",
      " Oh, wow.\n",
      "24547\n",
      " Yeah, I know, it really took a bite out of my video game time. What are you and Penny doing?\n",
      "24548\n",
      " Oh, I’m going to take her to a nice restaurant for dinner.\n",
      "24549\n",
      " Oh, that’s not bad, but as far as romance goes, I think my gift hits it right out of… (Bumps into chair and drops the slide)\n",
      "24550\n",
      " Want to come to dinner with us?\n",
      "24551\n",
      " Yes, please.\n",
      "24552\n",
      " Okay. Amy will be here shortly, expecting the perfect Valentine’s gift, so, you’re up kid. Dazzle me. Go.\n",
      "24553\n",
      " Now, see, I never would have thought to do that. Clearly, I made a good choice farming this out to you. But I am telling you, Amy hit the boyfriend jackpot. Anyway, my socks are on. Let’s knock them off.\n",
      "24554\n",
      " Now, Amy already has a real harp. And it can play any song. What are you trying to pull here?\n",
      "24555\n",
      " Next.\n",
      "24556\n",
      " Mmm.\n",
      "24557\n",
      " But she’s got Google Maps on her phone.\n",
      "24558\n",
      " Well, I hope it’s with a third good option, because these first two, buh.\n",
      "24559\n",
      " Wow. Oh, this is truly remarkable.\n",
      "24560\n",
      " I think I’ll keep it for myself.\n",
      "24561\n",
      " It’s too late. I call dibs.\n",
      "24562\n",

      "24565\n",
      " Sorry we’re late.\n",
      "24566\n",
      " No problem. We just sat down.\n",
      "24567\n",
      " Mmm, would you like some wine?\n",
      "24568\n",
      " Yeah, fill her up. I’ll tell you when to stop.\n",
      "24569\n",
      " Is everything okay?\n",
      "24570\n",
      " Terrific. Couldn’t be better.\n",
      "24571\n",
      " Oh, bite me.\n",
      "24572\n",
      " Look, we can still have a nice night. Just tell me where it is.\n",
      "24573\n",
      " Maybe if you did what you said you were going to do, I’d tell you.\n",
      "24574\n",
      " Uh, where what is?\n",
      "24575\n",
      " She hid my Xbox like I’m a child. Yeah, and my mom got me that for my birthday, so if you don’t give it back, I’m telling.\n",
      "24576\n",
      " I’ve been working late every night. All I asked was that he clean the apartment and do one load of laundry. But did he do it? No. He just kept on playing that stupid game. You like pushing buttons so much, try pushing them on the washing machine.\n",
      "24577\n",
      " I said I’m sorry.\n",
      "24578\n",
      " Sorry doesn’t clean my underpants, buddy.\n",
      "24579\n",

      "24587\n",
      " Oh.\n",
      "24588\n",
      " Until he cheated on me with my friend Gretchen, who’s here with him now.\n",
      "24589\n",
      " You’re kidding.\n",
      "24590\n",

      " I know it’s not ideal, but don’t let them ruin our night.\n",
      "24592\n",

      "24593\n",
      " That’s the spirit.\n",
      "24594\n",
      " You know what, screw them. Our night is going to be way more special than theirs.\n",

      " Uh-oh.\n",

      " It’s nice that all the people who are lonely on Valentine’s Day can come here tonight and be together.\n",
      "24602\n",
      " Except on a date with anybody.\n",
      "24603\n",
      " You know, you and I have so much fun hanging out. If you were a girl, all our problems would be solved.\n",
      "24604\n",
      " Oh, yeah, think about it. We’d hang out, we’d read comic books, we’d see movies. It’d be like the best relationship ever.\n",
      "24605\n",
      " Then I’d take you home, slip off your little black dress and just pile-drive you into oblivion.\n",
      "24606\n",
      " Oh, I can’t believe he’s going to marry the girl he cheated on me with.\n",
      "24607\n",
      " Isn’t it kind of nice? I mean, he was with the wrong person, and now he found the right person.\n",
      "24608\n",
      " What, so I’m the wrong person? Maybe you want to be with Gretchen, too.\n",
      "24609\n",
      " They do look happy.\n",
      "24610\n",
      " Yeah, maybe tonight. But a year from now, he’ll be crawling under the sink looking for his Xbox. Well, he will.\n",
      "24611\n",
      " You know what? Why don’t we just forget about them and enjoy our Valentine’s Day?\n",
      "24612\n",
      " Yes, absolutely. Now they’re doing that phony link-arm-drink thingy. I totally taught him that.\n",

But that doesn’t make us mutants. The only mutants here are in these comic books. We’ve got to stop defining our self-worth by whether or not we’re in a relationship.

      "24796\n",
      " Sadly, I’m no longer associated with that project.\n",
      "24797\n",
      " Why? What happened?\n",
      "24798\n",
      " Typical bureaucratic nonsense. You can get animals addicted to a harmful substance, you can dissect their brains, but you throw their own faeces back at them and suddenly you’re unprofessional.\n",

      "24812\n",
      " Really? Then what were you doing at the comic book store that night?\n",
      "24813\n",
      " Yeah, me neither.\n",
      "24814\n",

      "24816\n",
      " Oh, I totally am. If it wasn’t for this beer, I couldn’t even talk to you right now. I’m a wreck. There are many things seriously wrong with me. And not quirks, either. Like, diagnosable psychological problems. Maybe brain damage.\n",
      "24817\n",
      " Go out with me on one date, and I promise you, you’ll see.\n",
      "24818\n",

      "24819\n",
      " I think you have a great capacity for devotion. You’ll be lonely when she passes on, won’t you? I understand what that is.\n",
      "24820\n",
      " She’s pretty good, huh?\n",
      "24821\n",
      " She is. But when do they get to the part about streetcars?\n",

At nine thirty, I called and told him that one of my scallops tasted weird. At eleven thirty, I called and said I was throwing up like a fire hose. At twelve forty-five, I called and made nothing but dry heaving sounds, and now I’m going to Disneyland.\n",

I am here with my friends Dr. Cooper and real-life astronaut Howard Wolowitz, and we are going to show you girls how cool a job in science can be. How cool, you ask? Well, how about negative 273 degrees, ’cause that’s the temperature at which entropy reaches its minimum value. Did I just learn something new and have fun doing it? What? All right. So now let’s bring out theoretical physicist Dr. Sheldon Cooper.\n",

Co-discoverer of radioactivity, she was a hero of science, until her hair fell out, her vomit and stool became filled with blood, and she was poisoned to death by her own discovery. With a little hard work, I see no reason why that can’t happen to any of you. Are we done? Can we go?\n"

      " Whoa, you opened this?\n",
      "24993\n",

      "25007\n",
      " Sure. Just, when you say dressed up, you mean nice clothes, right? Not, like, capes and tights and crap?\n",

      " Why don’t you read it? Maybe he apologizes or explains why he left.\n",
      "25019\n",
      " He abandoned me and my mother. Why does he deserve a chance to explain anything?\n",
      "25020\n",

      "25027\n",

      " Okay. I’m just gonna tie my shoe while you think about that.\n",

      " Well, sure. I’m pretty passionate about science. I remember the first time I looked through a microscope and saw millions of tiny microorganisms. It was like a whole other universe. If I wanted to, I could wipe it out with my thumb like a god.\n",

      " Not Brian Boitano, that’s for sure. How’s your burrito?\n",
      "25457\n",

      "25459\n",

      "25470\n",

      "25805\n",
      " Okay, we just want to say, we feel really bad about…\n",
      "25806\n",
      " Go away! Sheldon is nibbling on my (sound of dice) 14! Yes!\n",
      "25807\n",
      " So, anyway, last night on video chat, I spent, like, twenty minutes just staring into Lucy’s eyes.\n",
      "25808\n",
      " Oh, that sounds romantic.\n",
      "25809\n",
      " It was until I realized the screen had frozen. Still one of my top three dates of all time.\n",
      "25810\n",
      " So, are we ever gonna hang out with this girl?\n",
      "25811\n",
      " I’d love that, but she’s not really comfortable around people.\n",
      "25812\n",
      " Yeah, I used to be uncomfortable around people, but then I learned a trick. I pretend everyone I meet is a beloved character from Star Trek.\n",
      "25813\n",
      " How’s that been working for you?\n",
      "25814\n",
      " Oh, like a charm, unnamed crewman in a red shirt.\n",
      "25815\n",
      " Leonard, I may have gotten you a job.\n",
      "25816\n",
      " I have a job.\n",
      "25817\n",
      " Yes, he does. He caters to my every whim.\n",
      "25818\n",
      " No, in a couple of weeks, Stephen Hawking’s team is sending an expedition to the North Sea to test hydrodynamic simulations of black holes. One of their experimental physicists dropped out, and I recommended you.\n",
      "25819\n",
      " Well, do you really think I have a shot?\n",
      "25820\n",
      " Yeah, I’ve worked with Hawking. I talked you up. He knows your research. I think this could happen.\n",
      "25821\n",
      " He knows, wow.\n",
      "25822\n",
      " Well, now, but do you think that’s a good idea? Uh, you know Star Trek. Should a guy with no name and a red shirt really go on an expedition?\n",
      "25823\n",
      " Hey, don’t discourage him. This is a fantastic opportunity.\n",
      "25824\n",
      " No one asked you, Uhura.\n",
      "25825\n",
      " Would you like to hear a classic Sheldon Cooper factoid?\n",
      "25826\n",
      " What do you think?\n",
      "25827\n",
      " Great. I’ve been doing some reading about vehicular safety. Did you know that the highest number of drowning accidents happen on or around boats?\n",
      "25828\n",
      " Interesting that you would bring that up when I might go work on a boat.\n",
      "25829\n",
      " Well, that’s the thing about factoids, they’re interesting.\n",
      "25830\n",
      " I know what you’re doing. You don’t want me going on this research trip because you’re afraid to be alone.\n",
      "25831\n",
      " I’m not afraid to be alone. On land. On the sea, it would be terrifying. Because of all the drowning.\n",
      "25832\n",
      " Sheldon.\n",
      "25833\n",
      " Fine, no more drowning talk. I’ll change the subject. Oh. Who do you think would win in a fight, you or a shark?\n",
      "25834\n",
      " Look, I appreciate your signature blend of concern for me and incredible selfishness. If I get the chance to do this, there is nothing you can say that’s going to stop me.\n",
      "25835\n",
      " Very well. Things between you and Penny have never been better. I hope four months apart doesn’t change anything. I should have opened with that, huh?\n",
      "25836\n",
      " If you look carefully at Venus, you should be able to see the International Space Station pass by.\n",
      "25837\n",
      " Yeah. He brought me back a T-shirt that said My Friend Went to the Space Station and All I Got Was This Lousy T-Shirt\n",
      "25838\n",
      " Nope. It’s exactly as lousy as advertised. Speaking of friends, they have been asking to meet you. I was thinking maybe we could all hang out sometime?\n",
      "25839\n",
      " Let’s see. Six. That’s pretty cool, I have six friends. Kind of like Sinatra.\n",
      "25840\n",
      " Okay, how about you just dip your toe in and meet one of them?\n",
      "25841\n",
      " Of course.\n",
      "25842\n",
      " So, then, during my afternoon shift, I spilled an entire tray of drinks on myself.\n",
      "25843\n",
      " Oh, that’s awful.\n",
      "25844\n",
      " Not really. My shirt was soaking wet. I got, like, the biggest tip of my life.\n",
      "25845\n",
      " So, listen, do you remember when I said the similarities of the equations of general relativity and hydrodynamics suggest you could find the equivalent of Unruh radiation in a large body of water?\n",
      "25846\n",
      " I thought I said that to you.\n",
      "25847\n",
      " Anyway, Stephen Hawking’s team is looking into that, and I’ve been invited to join them.\n",
      "25848\n",
      " Wow, Hawking. Good for you.\n",
      "25849\n",
      " Well, it is. Just, you know, I’d be gone for a while.\n",
      "25850\n",
      " Well, how long?\n",
      "25851\n",
      " Three, four months.\n",
      "25852\n",
      " Whoa. When would you leave?\n",
      "25853\n",
      " Couple of weeks.\n",
      "25854\n",
      " Wow. Oh, okay, well, I’ll just come visit you.\n",
      "25855\n",
      " That’s the thing, you can’t. I’ll be on a ship in the North Sea.\n",
      "25856\n",
      " On a ship? Aren’t they afraid Hawking will just roll overboard?\n",
      "25857\n",
      " Uh, he’s not gonna be there. He’s just sending a team to research his theory.\n",
      "25858\n",
      " Oh, sure. Like when you send me to kill spiders in your bathtub. Wow. Okay. Four months.\n"

      "25909\n",
      " It’s not that big of an opportunity. And even if Hawking’s theories are correct, all they prove is where the universe came from, why everything exists and what its ultimate end will be. I mean, me? I’m interested in the big questions.\n",

      " Look, sweetie, this is a natural thing to feel, okay? But just because good things are happening to Leonard doesn’t take anything away from you. You know what? Let me tell you a little story. Once there was a girl who worked at the Cheesecake Factory, and she wasn’t very good at her job.\n",
      "25913\n",
      " It was you.\n",
      "25914\n",

      "25915\n",
      " You ripped out your own fake blonde hair.\n",
      "25916\n",

      "25918\n",
      " Yeah.\n",
      "25919\n",
      " How?\n",
      "25920\n",
      " Like this. I am so happy for you.\n",
      "25921\n",
      " Wow. No wonder you didn’t get that toothpaste commercial.\n",
      "25922\n",
      " I want to apologize for Amy last night. She was completely out of line. Are you, are you not speaking to me or did the screen freeze again?\n",
      "25923\n",
      " Okay. I know. It was me. I, I pushed too hard. I’m sorry.\n",
      "25924\n",
      " You know, I, I’ve been thinking that maybe meeting somebody one-on-one is too intense, so Friday night, my friends are having a party.\n",
      "25925\n",
      " A little one. It’s, it’s a farewell for Leonard, so all the attention will be on him. If you wear something brown and sit on the couch, they won’t even know you’re there.\n",
      "25926\n",
      " Oh, please?\n",
      "25927\n",
      " Come on. Don’t make me beg. And I’m from India, so I know how to do it.\n",
      "25928\n",
      " Yeah, thank you! This means a lot to me. My friends are like my family. Unless you don’t like them, in which case, they’re dead to me.\n",
      "25929\n",
      " So, have you ever spent a long time on a boat before?\n",
      "25930\n",
      " Yeah.\n",
      "25931\n",
      " Are you referring to the time we got stuck on the Small World ride at Disneyland?\n",
      "25932\n",
      " Yeah.\n",
      "25933\n",
      " I’m proud of you, Leonard. Working out on the North Sea for months, that’s really something.\n",
      "25934\n",
      " I know. As far as science goes, this is the adventure of a lifetime.\n",
      "25935\n",
      " Maybe your lifetime. I went to space.\n",
      "25936\n",
      " It’s not a competition.\n",
      "25937\n",
      " You’re right, you’re right. I’m really proud of you, and I’m gonna miss you when you’re gone. And space beats water.\n",

      " Rajesh, I thought Lucy was coming.\n",
      "25939\n",
      " She is. She’s just running a little late. You know how it is, girls always fussing about their hair, their makeup. She’ll be here. Just give it a rest, okay?\n",
      "25940\n",
      " Um, can I have your attention, everyone? (Clinks glass) That’s, uh, B-flat, for those who don’t have perfect pitch. I would like to propose a toast to my best friend, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. He has been presented with a wonderful opportunity, and I couldn’t be happier for him.\n",
      "25941\n",
      " Thank you, Sheldon. That must’ve been very hard for you to say.\n",
      "25942\n",
      " Well, I mean it. I’m really happy for you. And that’s how you get a toothpaste commercial. Cheers.\n",

I know that now, thing’s aren’t good, they are in fact very very bad but at least my heart is starting to heal. Slowly but surely. And oh how I cried. It was like a little, uh, thunderstorm on my face. But I’m a man, okay? So I need to pull myself together, pick up a pen and get it all out in my journal. I mean, it’s not all bad, right? Having my heart broken has allowed me to finally speak in front of you, so, you know, a silver lining….\n",

      "26182\n",
      " Not my guy. I caught him staring at my rack. It’d be nice to be with a man who wants to know what’s underneath my cardigan. FYI, it’s another cardigan.\n",

      "26187\n",
      " No, no, no, that would be crazy. I mean, if I were hitting on you, you’d know it ’cause you’d feel uncomfortable and a little sad for me.\n",

      "26207\n",
      " I won’t.\n",
      "26208\n",
      " That criticism will come later in your report card.\n",

      "26293\n",
      " Oh, and here’s a fun thing. I worked it out so that there are two different words for spoon, planko and janko. Planko is a spoon with food, janko is a spoon without food. Janko is spelled with a silent ptang. Sheldon, you’re not even listening to the rules of my made-up language.\n",

      " What?\n",

      " I don’t think Penny would cheat on Leonard.\n",
      "26304\n",
      " Oh, really? She and I once had a staring contest. She clapped really loud and made me blink. It’s a small leap from there to sexual infidelity.\n",

      " You’re being ridiculous.\n",
      "26306\n",

      "26323\n",
      " Oh, no, I should apologize. Uh, I never realized to what extent our friendship was a burden to you.\n",
      "26324\n",
      " That is not fair. I complain about what a burden it is at least once a month.\n",
      "26325\n",
      " Oh, no, no, let’s not sugarcoat this. You find me finicky, pedantic and annoying.\n",
      "26326\n",
      " No, he doesn’t.\n",
      "26327\n",
      " I actually have used those exact words before. In that order.\n",

      " Yeah, yeah, yeah, very perky.\n",
      "26362\n",
      " Thank you. I really needed to hear that today. (Bernadette rolls eyes and walks out) Ooh, brie’s ready.\n",
      "26363\n",
      " Yay.\n",
      "26364\n",
      " Good morning.\n",
      "26365\n",
      " Hello.\n",
      "26366\n",
      " So am I driving you to work or are you still mad at me?\n",
      "26367\n",
      " I’d like a ride. Assuming you actually do take me to work.\n",
      "26368\n",
      " Where do you think I would take you?\n",
      "26369\n",
      " Who knows? Uh, you said you’d be home yesterday, but you came home three days ago. You say you’re taking me to work, but for all I know, I’ll end up in a deserted amusement park. Or a cornfield maze. Or a back alley dog fight. You tell me.\n",
      "26370\n",
      " I’m going to work. You can come if you want.\n",
      "26371\n",
      " Okay. By the way, you have something on your shirt.\n",
      "26372\n",
      " No, I don’t.\n",

      " I didn’t make it back. The ship sank, I’m in hell.\n",
      "26375\n",
      " You say you’re from New Jersey, but how can I believe you?\n",
      "26376\n",
      " Why would anyone claim to be from New Jersey if they weren’t?\n",
      "26377\n",
      " All right, I’ll give you that one.\n",
      "26378\n",
      " Hey, I said I was sorry. What else do you want from me?\n",
      "26379\n",
      " I want you to admit that what you did was wrong.\n",
      "26380\n",
      " Fine. What I did was wrong.\n",
      "26381\n",
      " I wish I could believe you.\n",
      "26382\n",
      " You know what? I’m not driving you to work, because you’re incredibly annoying.\n",
      "26383\n",
      " You say one thing and do the other, so then you are driving me and you find me a delight.\n",
      "26384\n",
      " Stop it.\n",
      "26385\n",
      " Keep it up?\n",

      " Bye.\n",
      "26387\n",
      " Hello. So I guess you’re really holding up the other four fingers?\n",
      "26388\n",
      " Oh, hey, what are you doing here so early?\n",
      "26389\n",
      " Driving Sheldon to work.\n",
      "26390\n",
      " He’s still mad at Leonard, huh?\n",
      "26391\n",
      " Well, he’s mad at you, too. He says you’re the succubus who led his friend astray.\n",
      "26392\n",
      " I don’t know what succubus is, but it has suck in it, so that can’t be good.\n",
      "26393\n",
      " Thought I heard you out here.\n",
      "26394\n",
      " Hey, Sheldon.\n",
      "26395\n",
      " You don’t get a hey. You get a hmm.\n",
      "26396\n",
      " Come on, don’t be like that. We had so much fun together the last couple of months.\n",
      "26397\n",
      " You’re right. Which makes your betrayal all the more devastating.\n",
      "26398\n",
      " Sheldon.\n",
      "26399\n",
      " I let you buy feminine hygiene products with my supermarket club card. You have any idea the kind of coupons I’m going to get in the mail now?\n",
      "26400\n",
      " Sheldon, your fight’s with Leonard. Penny’s got nothing to do…\n",
      "26401\n",
      " Careful, Amy. The friend of my enemy’s girlfriend is my enemy. \n",
      "26402\n",
      " Really?\n",
      "26403\n",
      " Yes. You’re either with me or against me.\n",
      "26404\n",
      " You want to take the bus to work?\n",
      "26405\n",
      " Maybe there’s a third option.\n",
      "26406\n",
      " FYI, I had a doughnut for breakfast, you jerk.\n",
      "26407\n",
      " So now we’re just waiting for the data from the ship to be crunched, but the numbers look pretty promising.\n",
      "26408\n",
      " That’s so great. If you guys prove the existence of Unruh radiation… Hey, hey, hey, hey. My eyes are up here.\n",
      "26409\n",
      " Howard, Raj. Judas.\n",
      "26410\n",
      " You know what? You’re a crazy person.\n",
      "26411\n",
      " A crazy person with a long memory, and if all goes according to plan, a robot army.\n",
      "26412\n",
      " Stop it.\n",
      "26413\n",
      " Or a mutant army. It depends on how my Kickstarter goes.\n",
      "26414\n",
      " I said, stop it. Now, listen to me. You two aren’t just friends. You’re best friends. And that’s a beautiful thing. I mean, Leonard, you know why he’s so mad at you? It’s ’cause he missed you. Yeah, and as his friend, you should be happy he has love in his life. As I do. This man held my breast the other day and I love him for it.\n",
      "26415\n",
      " A little loud, dude.\n",
      "26416\n",
      " So, can we please put aside these petty differences and just be glad we’re here together?\n",
      "26417\n",
      " Okay.\n",
      "26418\n",
      " I suppose so.\n",
      "26419\n",
      " Thank you.\n",
      "26420\n",
      " Uh, it wasn’t anything weird. It was just to see how big they were.\n",
      "26421\n",
      " And then Leonard took me to the barber and the dentist, and then to cap off the perfect day, the Los Angeles Bureau of Weights and Measures. \n",
      "26422\n",
      " I thought the measures were going to be the stars of the show, turns out it was the weights.\n",
      "26423\n",
      " I’m so glad you guys are friends again.\n",
      "26424\n",
      " And I’m glad you and I are friends again, too.\n",
      "26425\n",
      " Aw.\n",
      "26426\n",
      " Which reminds me. This came in the mail, and I want you to have it.\n",
      "26427\n",
      " Fifty cents off Vagisil.\n",
      "26428\n",
      " Think of me when you apply it.\n",
      "26429\n",
      " Uh, can I just say, I’ve missed all of us hanging out together.\n",
      "26430\n",
      " Yeah.\n",
      "26431\n",
      " Me, too.\n",
      "26432\n",
      " Um, since when can Koothrappali talk in front of the girls without a beer?\n",
      "26433\n",
      " Oh, that happened right after you left.\n",
      "26434\n",
      " And no one told me?\n",
      "26435\n",
      " So, couldn’t help but notice none of you RSVP’d to my murder mystery dinner party.\n",
      "26436\n",
      " Oh, yeah. We were meaning to do that.\n",
      "26437\n",
      " No, you weren’t because it was a week ago and nobody came. So, if you want to solve the mystery of who stabbed Koothrappali in the back with the weapon of indifference, it was all of you.\n",
      "26438\n",
      " I don’t think thatqualifies as a mystery, we all knew what we were doing.\n",
      "26439\n",
      " We’re sorry, Rajesh. \n",
      "26440\n",
      " Maybe we can do it next week.\n",
      "26441\n",
      " Whoa, whoa, we’re not that sorry.\n",
      "26442\n",
      " Don’t worry, I can take a hint. No more murder mystery parties.\n",
      "26443\n",
      " Great. \n",
      "26444\n",
      " Thank you.\n",
      "26445\n",
      " Hallelujah.\n",
      "26446\n",

      "26447\n",
      " Aw.\n",
      "26448\n",
      " Why?\n",
      "26449\n",
      " Come on.\n",
      "26450\n",
      " Just hear me out. I’m going to make you guys a scavenger hunt like they have at M.I.T.\n",
      "26451\n",
      " Oh, I loved those. I did them every year there.\n",
      "26452\n",
      " We did them at Princeton, too.\n",
      "26453\n",
      " Oh, that’s cute. Like it’s a real college.\n",
      "26454\n",
      " That’s amusing, I was going to say that about M.I.T., but it works for Princeton, too.\n",
      "26455\n",
      " Scavenger hunts at Harvard were really tough. I always got stuck on the first challenge, trying to find someone to be on a team with me. I guess that story’s more sad than funny.\n",
      "26456\n",
      " I love scavenger hunts. My friends and I had them all the time.\n",
      "26457\n",
      " Oh, these are a little different. There’s a tradition at elite universities…\n",
      "26458\n",
      " And Princeton.\n",
      "26459\n",
      " A tradition of hunts full of puzzles that rely on logic and obscure knowledge, science.\n",
      "26460\n",
      " Oh, in ours we would just run around town looking for a store that would sell us beer.\n",
      "26461\n",
      " So, uh, who’s in?\n",
      "26462\n",

      "26463\n",
      " Yeah, me, too.\n",
      "26464\n",
      " I’m sorry. Are we really doing this or are we tricking Koothrappali again like with the dinner party?\n",
      "26465\n",
      " What’s all this?\n",
      "26466\n",
      " Oh, everything I could possibly need to win the scavenger hunt.\n",
      "26467\n",
      " You really think he’s gonna send us to a bowling alley?\n",
      "26468\n",
      " Well, if he does, do you know how filthy those rental balls are? They might as well stand on the corner and give away free rectal exams.\n",
      "26469\n",
      " Okay, everybody. Who’s ready for a scavenger hunt? (Pumping disco music) Somewhere in the city of Pasadena, I’ve hidden a golden coin. You will be faced with a total of ten puzzles. Each p… (cough) each, each puzzle will lead you to the location of the next, the last of which will lead you to the coin. The first team that finds it wins.\n",

      " It’s not funny.\n",
      "26474\n",
      " No, Oh, it actually is if you get the joke. It’s based on the premise that Princeton isn’t a very good school. \n",
      "26475\n",
      " Ha-ha.\n",
      "26476\n",
      " Oh, see? Now he gets it.\n",
      "26477\n",
      " Okay, guys, go ahead and divide yourselves into teams of two.\n",
      "26478\n",
      " Should we just do couples?\n",
      "26479\n",
      " Couples sounds great. Or we could mix things up. Maybe pick names out of a hat. Whatever.\n",
      "26480\n",

      " Oh, simple, the ‘arrah, ‘arrah in the riddle mean Jan Arrah, a member of the Legion of Superheroes, known as Element Lad. And then the word He, it wasn’t the masculine pronoun, but rather H e, the abbreviation for helium. See where I’m going with this?\n",
      "26568\n",
      " Yes.\n",
      "26569\n",
      " Nice try. Now, Element Lad’s ability is the power to transmute chemical elements. Helium has an atomic number of two. If you multiply that by the atomic number of N, nitrogen, you get 14, which is the atomic number of? I’m just funnin’ you, silicon. And that is the most common element in the Earth’s surface. So that narrowed it down to the geology lab or the chemistry lab.\n",

      "26743\n",
      " Nothing, I’m fine.\n",
      "26744\n",
      " All right, hang on. is this still about your mom’s book?\n",
      "26745\n",
      " No. Not everything is about my mom. \n",
      "26746\n",
      " ‘Cause if you’re still upset about that, we don’t have to go.\n",
      "26747\n",
      " Except this is totally about my mom.\n",
      "26748\n",
      " I’m so sorry. I never should have read that book. You know what? You want to just get dinner and watch the game here?\n",
      "26749\n",
      " That sounds nice. Yeah.\n",
      "26750\n",
      " Okay.\n",
      "26751\n",
      " Or, you know, we could get take-out and watch the Blu-ray extended version of The Hobbit movie with commentary track. On account of how sad I am about my mom.\n",
      "26752\n",
      " Leonard, you ready for lunch?\n",
      "26753\n",
      " One sec. Hey. Sorry.\n",
      "26754\n",
      " Hi, Penny.\n",
      "26755\n",
      " Hi. All right, sweetie. You hang in there today.\n",
      "26756\n",
      " I’ll try, but I might be sad again tonight.\n",
      "26757\n",
      " Okay.\n",
      "26758\n",
      " Wow. Sex at work?\n",
      "26759\n",
      " Leave it alone. That’s my girlfriend.\n",
      "26760\n",
      " Sorry. \n",
      "26761\n",
      " Who just had sex with me at work.\n",
      "26762\n",
      " Damn. How’d you swing that?\n",
      "26763\n",
      " Well, whenever I talk about how awful my mom was, Penny will do anything to make me feel better.\n",
      "26764\n",
      " Seriously?\n",
      "26765\n",
      " Look, I mean, I’m not proud of it, but it does work. I got her to watch a six-part documentary on Monty Python. Even I was bored, I just wanted to see if she’d make it to the end.\n",
      "26766\n",
      " You sound kind of proud of it.\n",
      "26767\n",
      " I am, I’m really proud.\n",
      "26768\n",
      " Yes. Why?\n",
      "26769\n",
      " Well, the last time you made an unscheduled video-chat, there was a curly fry in your regular fries and you thought someone might be trying to slip you a mickey.\n",
      "26770\n",
      " April 13, a dark night, indeed.\n",
      "26771\n",
      " So what can I do for you?\n",
      "26772\n",
      " I’m calling to invite you to a spontaneous date night tomorrow evening.\n",
      "26773\n",
      " Really?\n",
      "26774\n",
      " Yes. You were kind enough to watch Raiders of the Lost Ark with me. So I’d like to return the favour by inviting you to watch an episode of your favourite childhood television series, Little House on the Prairie.\n",
      "26775\n",
      " That sounds lovely. Why are you rubbing your hands together?\n",
      "26776\n",
      " Um, I’m putting on lotion. Are you in or not?\n",
      "26777\n",
      " Of course I’m in.\n",
      "26778\n",
      " Excellent. Then I shall see you tomorrow. Good night, Dr. Fowler.\n",
      "26779\n",
      " Good night, Dr. Cooper.\n",
      "26780\n",
      " Good night, indeed. What a rube. Why would I put on lotion when I have such soft hands?\n",
      "26781\n",
      " You were really quiet during dinner. Is everything okay?\n",
      "26782\n",
      " Yeah. I guess I was just thinking about my mom, and how sad my childhood was.\n",
      "26783\n",
      " Yeah, I bet it sucked. I’m gonna take a bath, you do the dishes.\n",
      "26784\n",
      " How about I take a bath with you and see what happens.\n",
      "26785\n",
      " Here’s what’s gonna happen. I’m gonna take a bath, and you’re gonna do the dishes.\n",
      "26786\n",
      " That’s it? No compassion?\n",
      "26787\n",
      " Aw, poor Howie. We good? I’m gonna take a bath.\n",
      "26788\n",
      " Bernie…\n",
      "26789\n",
      " God, what is going on with you? \n",
      "26790\n",
      " I’m sharing my pain.\n",
      "26791\n",
      " And I’m not buying it. Try again.\n",
      "26792\n",
      " I’m learning to be a man in a culture where it’s increasingly difficult to know how?\n",
      "26793\n",
      " I’m copying Leonard. When he does this to Penny, they have sex and watch Monty Python.\n",
      "26794\n",
      " Howard.\n",
      "26795\n",
      " I know. It was dumb, I shouldn’t have done it. And it’s making me feel sad. So sad. You know, why don’t you take a bath? I’ll do the dishes.\n",
      "26796\n",
      " Three, two, one. \n",
      "26797\n",
      " Attention all shoppers, my business is open for business!\n",
      "26798\n",
      " Oh, cool, it tells you when someone’s reading your profile. Jenny309. I hope that’s not her weight. \n",
      "26799\n",
      " What? Another one. You know, it, it’s weird. When they’re reading your profile, does it, does it make you feel exposed? Like they see you naked?\n",
      "26800\n",
      " I love Little House. It made me want to live on a farm so much I tried to milk my cat. That tangy bowl of Cheerios was not worth the stitches.\n",
      "26801\n",
      " Well, you sit back, relax and enjoy a beloved childhood memory. You see that cabin there? I read they were illegally squatting on Indian land. Yeah. Personally, I think what we did to the Native Americans was wrong, but this is your favourite show, not mine. Oh, look at little Laura Ingalls, eating that peanut butter sandwich. Peanut butter? Huh? That’s strange, since peanut butter wasn’t introduced until the early 1900s. If I knew this show was about time travel, I would have watched it much sooner.\n",
      "26802\n",
      " You’re trying to get back at me for what I said about Raiders of the Lost Ark.\n",
      "26803\n",
      " That’s silly. Almost as silly as Dr. Baker having a telephone, since telephones only existed in large cities at that time. This is more like Little House on the Preposterous.\n",
      "26804\n",
      " Sheldon, we’re in a relationship. When you get angry, just tell me. You don’t need to seek revenge.\n",
      "26805\n",
      " Are you sure? Every time my dad stayed out all night, my mom would put hamster poop in his chewing tobacco.\n",
      "26806\n",
      " Well, that’s not how we’re going to do it.\n",
      "26807\n",
      " Fine. I’m mad at you. Not only did you ruin Raiders for me, you may have ruined the whole franchise. Except for the fourth one, which was bad before you got your mitts on it.\n",
      "26808\n",
      " I shouldn’t have said it. I’m sorry.\n",
      "26809\n",
      " Thank you.\n",
      "26810\n",
      " Do you feel better?\n",
      "26811\n",
      " Yes. But not as good as I’m going to when I tell you that your precious Garfield has no reason to hate Mondays. He’s a cat. He doesn’t have a job.\n",
      "26812\n",
      " Hey, I was just… what is happening?\n",
      "26813\n",
      " Oh, just a little treat. I know you’ve been feeling really bad about your mom lately.\n",
      "26814\n",
      " Oh, oh, I have. So bad.\n",
      "26815\n",
      " And I wanted to make you feel better, so I planned something very special for you.\n",
      "26816\n",
      " Uh-huh, I can already feel it working.\n",
      "26817\n",
      " Mom?\n",
      "26818\n",
      " I… uh…\n",
      "26819\n",
      " Bernadette told me everything. Now you don’t get the left or the right.\n",
      "26820\n",
      " Oh, please, Mommy. No, Mommy.\n",
      "26821\n",
      " I didn’t dream that?\n",
      "26822\n",
      " Penny, come back. I’m sad for real now.\n",
      "26823\n",
      " In the last two hours, 162 women have read our profiles. How many of them have sent us messages?\n",
      "26824\n",
      " Yes.\n",
      "26825\n",
      " Dude, this is, this is brutal. \n",
      "26826\n",
      " This is the worst. If we’re gonna get shot down, we might as well just go to a bar and do it old school.\n",
      "26827\n",
      " Yeah, anything is better than this.\n",
      "26828\n",
      " Hello.\n",
      "26829\n",
      " I was wrong. This is worse.\n",
      "26830\n",
      " Wait, wait, if it wasn’t for Indiana Jones, the ark would never have ended up at the warehouse. \n",
      "26831\n",
      " That’s true. He collected and delivered the ark to the proper authorities for filing.\n",
      "26832\n",
      " Like a hero.\n",
      "26833\n",
      " Although, technically, Indy was supposed to take the ark to a museum to be studied. He couldn’t even get that done.\n",
      "26834\n",
      " Awkward silence, Sheldon on his phone, no touching. Somebody’s having date night.\n",
      "26835\n",
      " It’s actually steamier than it looks. Sheldon’s looking up the phallic symbolism of root vegetables in Renaissance paintings.\n",
      "26836\n",
      " Oh, no, I got bored with that. I’m just browsing cuticle scissors on Amazon.\n",
      "26837\n",
      " How do you not tear off his clothes and take him right here on this table?\n",
      "26838\n",
      " If you do that, I’ll scream.\n",
      "26839\n",
      " Sheldon, I have some exciting news to tell you.\n",
      "26840\n",
      " That makes two of us. My new cuticle scissors will be here in one to two business days. Come on, one.\n",
      "26841\n",
      " I’ve been invited to consult on an experiment at your university for a few months. Isn’t that great? We could have lunch together. We could carpool. \n",
      "26842\n",
      " You know, riding with Leonard has gotten a little tedious lately. The only car game he ever wants to play is the Quiet Game. And he’s terrible at it, I always win.\n",
      "26843\n",
      " So, you’re okay with this?\n",
      "26844\n",
      " Well, why wouldn’t I be?\n",
      "26845\n",
      " Well, this project would have us working in close proximity to one another. And there’s the vulgar adage that one should not defecate where one eats.\n",
      "26846\n",
      " My father used to say that all the time. That and, um, who does one have to orally gratify to get a drink around here? But what does that have to do with you working at the university?\n",
      "26847\n",
      " Sheldon, don’t defecate where you eat means don’t have a romantic relationship in the workplace.\n",
      "26848\n",
      " Really?\n",
      "26849\n",
      " Yes.\n",
      "26850\n",

      "27071\n",
      " Great. Will you play the ukulele?\n",
      "27072\n",
      " Of course. I’d be happy to shred it on my ax.\n",
      "27073\n",

      "27074\n",
      " Fine. I will melt her heart. And her face.\n",
      "27075\n",
      " Gentlemen. Uh, no doubt you heard about my little breakthrough. Now, if your plan is to hoist me on your shoulders and carry me around the cafeteria, please refrain. I don’t care for heights, motion sickness or the thought of your necks touching my buttocks. \n",
      "27076\n",
      " Seriously, congratulations, Sheldon.\n",
      "27077\n",
      " Yeah, I read your paper online. That technique for creating a new heavy element is inspired.\n",
      "27078\n",
      " Oh, well, thank you. Believe it or not, I just learned a Chinese research team at the Hubei Institute for Nuclear Physics ran a test on a cyclotron, and the results were extremely promising.\n",
      "27079\n",
      " Sheldon, that’s incredible.\n",
      "27080\n",
      " Yeah, I know. They called it the greatest thing since the Communist party. Although I’m pretty sure that the Communist party made them say that. I like China. See, they know how to keep people in line.\n"

      " What are you talking about?\n",
      "27112\n",
      " This table, it’s in square centimetres. I read it as square metres. You know what that means?\n",
      "27113\n",
      " That Americans can’t handle the metric system?\n",
      "27114\n",
      " Amy, I was off by a factor of 10,000. \n",
      "27115\n",
      " But the Chinese team found the element.\n",
      "27116\n",
      " Yeah, well, they shouldn’t have. My calculations were wrong. There must be some resonance between the elements I didn’t know about.\n",

      "27119\n",
      " You and me both, brother. It doesn’t matter. The element was found because of you, and that’s groundbreaking.\n",
      "27120\n",
      " What matters is the greatest scientific achievement of my life is based on a blunder. I’m not a genius, I’m a fraud.\n",
      "27121\n",
      " You know, Sheldon, in neuroscience, we’re forever finding something in one part of the brain that we thought was someplace else.\n",
      "27122\n",
      " Oh, great. Now I’m worse than a fraud. I’m practically a biologist.\n",

      " No, Leonard, this is going to haunt me for the rest of my life. Every science classroom, every periodic table, every textbook, this mistake will be staring back at me. Like that time you let Koothrappali wax your eyebrows. I’ve got to find a way to stop this thing.\n",
      "27126\n",
      " Buddy, I don’t think you can. I mean, once it’s out there, it’s out there. This thing is like the science equivalent of a sex tape.\n",
      "27127\n",

      "27140\n",
      " And no woos. Oh, not you, Dr. Woo. You’re fine. I want you all to know that you have no reason to applaud me. My so-called breakthrough wasn’t the result of my genius. It was nothing more than a boneheaded mistake. So please refrain from praising me for it in the future.\n",
      "27141\n",
      " Wait, I don’t understand. They didn’t find the element?\n",
      "27142\n",
      " Oh, no, they found the element. (More applause) No, no, stop it. I don’t need to take this admiration from the likes of you people. How do I make them stop loving me?\n",
      "27143\n",
      " Invite them to live with us.\n",
      "27144\n",
      " Boy, Bernadette is gonna love this.\n",
      "27145\n",
      " Yeah. It must be nice to have someone do something so romantic.\n",
      "27146\n",
      " Okay, you know what’s not romantic? Rubbing it in someone’s face.\n",
      "27147\n",
      " Actually, it can be, but I told you sex doesn’t count.\n",
      "27148\n",

      "27149\n",

      " I know. When will this nightmare end?\n",
      "27152\n",
      " Hey, I get that you feel bad about all the attention, but still, what you did is amazing. We’re really proud of you.\n",
      "27153\n",

      "27154\n",
      " You’re not?\n",
      "27155\n",
      " Sheldon, I’ve been thinking about it, and you’re right. You don’t deserve any credit. All you did was misread some numbers on a table. A very easy table, too. Honestly, I’m embarrassed for you.\n",
      "27156\n",
      " That’s the most romantic thing I’ve ever heard.\n",
      "27157\n",

      "27161\n",
      " Yeah, but she’s at the hospital in quarantine.\n",

      " You’re sure you’re okay?\n",
      "27169\n",

      " Oh, don’t worry about it. I brought the date here. Guys, come on in.\n",

      " Shh.\n",
      "27179\n",
      " A candle without a wick, a Watson without a Crick, I’d be one of my outfits without a dick-ie. I’d be cheese without the mac, Jobs without the Wozniak, I’d be solving exponential equations that use bases not found on your calculator making it much harder to crack. I’d be an atom without a bomb, a dot without the com, and I’d probably still live with my mom.\n",
      "27180\n",
      " Ever since I met you, you turned my world around. You supported all my dreams and all my hopes. You’re like uranium-235 and I’m uranium-238, almost inseparable isotopes. I couldn’t have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that I met you Bernadette.\n",
      "27181\n",
      " Oh, Howie.\n",
      "27182\n",
      " If I didn’t have you life would be dreary, I’d be string theory without any string. I’d be binary code without a one, a cathode ray tube without an electron gun. I’d be Firefly, Buffy and Avengers without Joss Whedon. I’d speak a lot more Klingon, Heghlu’meH QaQ jajvam. \n",
      "27183\n",
      " Ever since I met you, you turned my world around. You’re my best friend and my lover. We’re like changing electric and magnetic fields. You can’t have one without the other. I couldn’t have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that I met you, Bernadette.\n",
      "27184\n",

Now, I know he said it’s promising and he’s going to collaborate on it, but now that you and I are friends again, I am at your disposal. And, um, frankly, lending my name and reputation to it will help, because a lot of people think that you’re a washed-up has-been. Or dead.\n",

      " Skee-Ball tickets?\n",
      "27397\n",
      " Yeah, from when we went to the arcade three years ago? I finally decided what prize I want. Hurry up.\n",
      "27398\n",
      " Uh, if I still have them, they’re probably in the junk box.\n",
      "27399\n",

      " Yup, oh, here you go.\n",
      "27402\n",
      " Oh, thank you. Here, get yourself an eraser for your troubles.\n",

      "27404\n",
      " Aw, did she hate you?\n",
      "27405\n",
      " Why? Because I got an ugly, itchy sweater, and my brother got a car? No, I was her favorite.\n",
      "27406\n",
      " I seem to be a few tickets short. Are there more in the box?\n",
      "27407\n",
      " Hmm, I think I got them all. Nope, they’re not in there.\n",
      "27408\n",

      "27409\n",
      " No, no, no, I, I looked, and there’s, there’s, there’s no more tickets.\n",

      "27414\n",
      " Okay, Sheldon, I know I was supposed to return this DVD a long time ago, and I know we rented it on your card. But it’s been, like, seven years and clearly nothing bad has happened. So in-in-in-instead of being a giant pain in the ass like you always are, what if this one time you just tried staying calm?\n",
      "27415\n",
      " That seems like a reasonable request. Although so did, hey, Leonard, would you mind returning that DVD?\n",
      "27416\n",
      " I’m sorry. I’ll, I’ll take care of it.\n",
      "27417\n",

      "27423\n",
      " Yeah, it’s freaking me out. I’m gonna go.\n",
      "27424\n",
      " So, when you say you’re not going to freak out about the DVD, here’s what that means. Don’t fixate on it. Don’t wake me up in the middle of the night. Or nag me through the door while I’m on the toilet.\n",
      "27425\n",
      " Okay, first, talking to you while you’re on the toilet isn’t exactly a picnic for me either, okay? Remember, when you can hear me, I can hear you. And second, you completely disregard how uncomfortable unresolved issues are for me. It’s, it’s like, a, an itch in my brain I can’t scratch.\n",
      "27426\n",
      " When I broke my arm I used to stick a coat hanger down there. You ever try that? Maybe go in through the ear?\n",
      "27427\n",
      " You wouldn’t make jokes if you could feel the way I feel.\n",
      "27428\n",
      " Well, I don’t know how to do that.\n",
      "27429\n",
      " How about this? I promise I won’t pester you about the DVD. You can defecate in peace. That’s a win for both of us. But, until this matter is resolved, I would like you to wear this sweater. With nothing underneath it.\n",
      "27430\n",
      " That’s stupid. Why?\n",
      "27431\n",
      " You say it’s itchy and uncomfortable. I say situations like this make me feel the same way. \n",
      "27432\n",
      " I’m telling you, try the hanger.\n",
      "27433\n",
      " Put it on. Let’s share the experience.\n",
      "27434\n",
      " You got it. If this sweater shuts you up, I’m gonna make a fortune selling them to everyone we know. Now all I need to do is head down to the video store and return the DVD.\n",

      " You had to be taught not to play with cobras?\n",
      "27477\n",
      " You had to be taught not to burn down the forest?\n",
      "27478\n",
      " Hey, if you guys were hungry, why didn’t you order something at the restaurant?\n",
      "27479\n",
      " We did, you never brought it.\n",
      "27480\n",
      " Oh, that’s right. Nachos and a turkey club.\n",
      "27481\n",
      " Not even close.\n",
      "27482\n",
      " Well, I was too busy standing up for my friend to worry about your, I want to say salmon.\n",
      "27483\n",
      " You want to say sorry.\n",
      "27484\n",
      " So, how are you gonna tell Raj abut what you did?\n",
      "27485\n",
      " What do you mean how? What’s the big deal?\n",
      "27486\n",
      " You told Lucy he was a pathetic mess.\n",
      "27487\n",
      " Then you made her cry and leave.\n",
      "27488\n",
      " Okay, you guys are overreacting. Raj is gonna appreciate how I had his back.\n",
      "27489\n",
      " What is wrong with you, Penny? You ruined any chance I had of getting back with Lucy. Now she knows I’m a desperate mess instead of just being pretty sure. (Phone text sound) It’s Lucy. She wants to meet for coffee. I love you, Penny.\n",
      "27490\n",
      " Hey, what’re you working on?\n",
      "27491\n",
      " I’m thinking about how one could use the fact that a rapidly rotating mirror turns virtual photons into real ones as a method of observing dark energy.\n",
      "27492\n",
      " That’s a pretty cool idea.\n",
      "27493\n",
      " Yeah. It’s great you’re here. I’d love to get an engineer’s opinion.\n",
      "27494\n",
      " Sure.\n",
      "27495\n",
      " This chair is squeaky. Now, do I fix it or get a new one?\n",
      "27496\n",
      " Well, Sheldon, it took me all morning, but I found the owner of the video store. And I am happy to report that he died peacefully in his sleep, drunk at the bottom of a pool. Anyway, there is no one to return the DVD to, so this issue is resolved. Ah! And I’d just like to point out that even though the sweater was uncomfortable, I didn’t use it as an excuse to antagonize everyone around me.\n",
      "27497\n",
      " You know, you could reimburse the video store owner’s next of kin.\n",
      "27498\n",
      " Or it’s resolved.\n",
      "27499\n",
      " Hey, that next of kin thing sounds pretty good.\n",
      "27500\n",
      " I believe this is yours.\n",
      "27501\n",
      " Can I ask you guys a question? So, I’m seeing Lucy tomorrow night, and I’ve never hung out with someone who broke up with me. How do you do it?\n",
      "27502\n",
      " You can’t let her know you’re hurting. You know, the key is confidence.\n",
      "27503\n",
      " Why is the key always confidence? How come it’s never love handles and flop sweat?\n",
      "27504\n",
      " If this girl hurt you so much, are you sure you want to see her again?\n",
      "27505\n",
      " Well, if I may, he has so little self-respect and is so desperate for the smallest crumb of affection, she could literally sleep with his own father in his own bed and post the video to YouTube, and he’d still buy her flowers and ask her to be his bride.\n",
      "27506\n",
      " He’s right. But in my defence, if we could survive that, we could survive anything.\n",
      "27507\n",
      " Well, if you’re sure you want to do this, it’s only coffee, just relax and see what happens.\n",
      "27508\n",
      " Well, can I say she looks nice?\n",
      "27509\n",
      " Sure.\n",
      "27510\n",
      " Can I tell her I miss her?\n",
      "27511\n",
      " Maybe, if she asks.\n",
      "27512\n",
      " Oh, can I show her an oil painting I made of us surrounded by our children and grandchildren?\n",
      "27513\n",
      " I’d save that for the second date.\n",
      "27514\n",
      " Good, good. ‘Cause no matter how hard I try, I cannot get the twins to look alike.\n",
      "27515\n",
      " What are you doing?\n",
      "27516\n",
      " Oh, I’m just trying to find the stupid next of kin to this stupid video store owner so I can return the DVD and see the look on Sheldon’s stupid face when he sees that I didn’t let this get to me.\n",
      "27517\n",
      " Sheldon’s not here. Why don’t you take the sweater off?\n",
      "27518\n",
      " There’s a principle at stake.\n",
      "27519\n",
      " Which is?\n",
      "27520\n",
      " Oh, I don’t know. Who cares? Look at me.\n",
      "27521\n",
      " Oh, my God! Is that sweater made of bees? Come on, take it off. I won’t tell.\n",
      "27522\n",
      " No, no, honey, if I take it off, Sheldon wins.\n",
      "27523\n",
      " Sweetie, every night you don’t kill him in his sleep, he wins.\n",
      "27524\n",
      " No, it’s, it’s almost done. I just, I have to find the next of kin, and send ’em the DVD and then just wait for someone with my complexion to die so I can get a skin graft.\n",
      "27525\n",
      " Smile.\n",
      "27526\n",
      " What is that? What is that for?\n",
      "27527\n",
      " So you can send it to Princeton and get your money back.\n",
      "27528\n",
      " I must say, Sheldon, you’re handling this DVD business with an impressive amount of maturity.\n",
      "27529\n",
      " I don’t know why that surprises you. I’m a grown man. As should be evident by this sport coat and very real flower in my lapel.\n",
      "27530\n",
      " Is there some kind of new coping mechanism you’re employing?\n",
      "27531\n",
      " The more interesting question you should be asking is, what does this flower smell like?\n",
      "27532\n",
      " I’m gonna go with sad. So what’s the story with you and this DVD?\n",
      "27533\n",
      " There’s nothing to tell. Maybe I purchased a book entitled Don’t Sweat the Small Stuff and I followed its wise suggestions, one of which was stop and smell the flowers.\n",
      "27534\n",
      " Seriously?\n",
      "27535\n",
      " Please. Ha-ha, Oh.\n",
      "27536\n",
      " Hello. Oh, it’s so good to see you.\n",
      "27537\n",
      " Please, sit. I, uh, I got you a cappuccino. I remembered it was your favourite. I also got crumb cake, but I remembered it was my favourite and I ate it. Anyway, uh, how are you?\n",
      "27538\n",
      " Well, and I ate all the crumb cake. We both made mistakes.\n",
      "27539\n",
      " I’m so happy you asked me here, and I hope we can hang out again sometime. You know, as friends, lovemaking partners, whatever.\n",
      "27540\n",
      " I think I know the answer to this, but just to be clear, it’s not me, right?\n",
      "27541\n",
      " This is all your fault, I should’ve listened to Mun-Mun because I’ve been playing with a cobra and her name is Penny. Why are you so cruel? Do you enjoy my pain?\n",
      "27542\n",
      " There’s a girl at the Cheesecake Factory I can set you up with.\n",
      "27543\n",
      " I love you, Penny.\n",
      "27544\n",
      " How is it I can conceptualize a methodology of examining dark matter in the universe but can’t figure out how to fix a novelty squirt flower?\n",
      "27545\n",
      " I think the real question is, why do you waste your time with cheap, childish pranks?\n",
      "27546\n",
      " There’s probably a deep reason. Which I’d be happy to discuss with you over some peanut brittle in a can.\n",
      "27547\n",
      " Okay, Sheldon, I am out of options. Video store owner, Nursis Manookian, has no next of kin.\n",
      "27548\n",
      " Well, you seem hot under the collar, or is that the sweater?\n",
      "27549\n",
      " Oh, oh, no, no. It’s because I spent all afternoon at the Armenian church where his funeral mass was held. According to Father Solakian, no one attended. Luckily, my trip wasn’t a complete waste. I lit a candle and prayed for your death but I’m not Armenian, so it probably won’t work. This is over, right?\n",
      "27550\n",
      " Oh, not necessarily. I suggest you look for long-lost relatives either in Armenia or Lebanon.\n",
      "27551\n",
      " Listen to me, Sheldon. I am not going to Lebanon to return Super Mario Brothers the movie.\n",
      "27552\n",

      " I will. Why are you making this such a big deal?\n",
      "27630\n",
      " Oh, oh, oh, I have a reason. It could be because you said yes to marrying Zack, but every time Leonard’s proposed, he’s gotten a resounding no. Yeah, that’s just off the top of my head.\n",
      "27631\n",
      " So how do I undo this?\n",
      "27632\n",

      " Great, well, what do I have to do?\n",
      "27634\n",
      " It says here you can get an annulment if any of the following conditions are met. Were you unable to consummate the marriage?\n",

      " Hah!Penny? Next.\n",
      "27636\n",

      "27650\n",

      "27859\n",
      " No, no, of course you have to publish. That’s your responsibility as a scientist. Doing otherwise would be unethical. You have no choice.\n",

      " Aw, you didn’t have to do that.\n",
      "27867\n",

      " Oh, come on, I brought you one, too.\n",
      "27876\n",

      " Give me that. Just stop showing me up.\n",
      "27879\n",
      " Howard, listen to me. You’re a great husband. Yes, your listening skills could use some work. But it’s amazing how far you’ve come given that you’re an only child raised by an over-protective mom.\n",

      " Um, is this getting weird?\n",
      "27881\n",

      " Hey. I just wanted to let you know that I, I posted my findings.\n",
      "27884\n",
      " I saw. And I just posted a retraction of my paper. Now the whole scientific community knows I was wrong.\n",
      "27885\n",
      " These things happen all the time, Sheldon.\n",
      "27886\n",
      " Not to me. The only other retraction I ever had to issue was when I was seven and I conceded that my brother was the greatest ninja in East Texas. But that was just a ploy to get my face out of his armpit.\n",
      "27887\n",
      " Come on, don’t give him a hard time.\n",
      "27888\n",
      " It’s not a big deal.\n",
      "27889\n",
      " Okay, Barry, that’s enough.\n",
      "27890\n",
      " No, no, no, that’s okay. I can fight my own battles. Isn’t that right, Bawwy.\n",
      "27891\n",
      " You’re right, That was uncalled for. I take it back.\n",
      "27892\n",
      " Raj, this dinner was amazing. If you’re here much longer, I’m gonna have to buy bigger clothes.\n",
      "27893\n",
      " Nonsense. You need a little fattening up. You’ve been looking too skinny lately.\n",
      "27894\n",
      " Aw. Howie, how come you never say anything sweet like that?\n",
      "27895\n",
      " What are you talking about? Remember last week, when I asked you if you were wearing Spanx and you weren’t? How’s that different?\n",
      "27896\n",
      " Maybe you could try being more thoughtful, like your friend Raj.\n",
      "27897\n",
      " Yeah, well, maybe you could try being more like Raj. \n",
      "27898\n",
      " Oh, really?\n",
      "27899\n",
      " Yeah, yeah. He packed me a lunch this morning. And there was a note inside that said go get ’em.\n",
      "27900\n",
      " Like I don’t do enough around here. Now I need to pack your lunch? And by the way, why do you need a note telling you to go get ’em? You’re a grown man, you should know to go get ’em.\n",
      "27901\n",
      " I do know to go get ’em, but sometimes it’s nice to have emotional support when I’m going and getting them.\n",
      "27902\n",
      " Hey, hey, do you hear yourselves? Let’s just, you know, all calm down and take a step back.\n",
      "27903\n",
      " This is stupid. Why are we fighting?\n",
      "27904\n",
      " I don’t know. I guess I was just feeling like I’m a lousy husband.\n",
      "27905\n",

      "27908\n",
      " You made us feel like we’re not trying hard enough.\n",

      "27910\n",

      "27926\n",

      "28249\n",
      " You still got the part. That’s a huge accomplishment.\n",
      "28250\n",
      " Yeah, but this was supposed to be my break, okay? People were gonna see me in this show and it was gonna lead to bigger things. More auditions, more parts. Now none of that’s gonna happen.\n",

      " I don’t, look, you know, words don’t always have to mean things.\n",
      "28256\n",

      "28257\n",

      "28271\n",
      " That is not what I said. Look, I think you’re really good. I truly do. But this is an incredibly hard thing that you’re shooting for. I mean, the odds of anyone becoming a successful actor are like a million to one.\n",

      " Excellent.\n",
      "28281\n",
      " No. No pretty girls. The point is to talk to regular people and work our way up to pretty girls.\n",

      " Hey. Can we talk?\n",
      "28295\n",
      " We can, but the part of Penny might get cut.\n",
      "28296\n",
      " That was really crappy of me. What you’re trying to do is hard, but people do make it, and I really do believe you could be one of them.\n",
      "28297\n",
      " Thank you.\n",
      "28298\n",

      "28300\n",
      " The new Star Wars movie.\n",
      "28301\n",
      " What? How did you manage that?\n",

      " There’s this thing online, you put yourself on tape and just send it in, anyone can do it.\n",
      "28303\n",
      " Come on Leonard, this is just a PR stunt.\n",
      "28304\n",
      " So? Even if it is, you have a huge advantage because you’re an actual actress. Most of the people doing this are just weirdoes and nerds. Wolowitz sent his in two days ago.\n",
      "28305\n",
      " Really, let it go.\n",
      "28306\n",
      " Look, maybe it is a long shot, but sometimes long shots happen. Luke Skywalker was only given one chance to destroy the Death Star. He had to get a torpedo into an exhaust port that was only two meters wide, but with the help of The Force, he… wow, I can feel you hating me right now.\n",
      "28307\n",
      " Yeah, she seems friendly and easy to… never mind, she’s gone. You know, maybe talking to people is too hard.\n",
      "28308\n",

      "28313\n",
      " That’s interesting.\n",
      "28314\n",
      " It’s exhausting. Do you have any idea how hard it is to laugh at a knock-knock joke that starts with knock-knock-knock, Amy, knock-knock-knock, Amy, knock-knock-knock, Amy?\n",
      "28315\n",
      " If you want him to stop, sometimes the easiest thing to do is just fake a laugh.\n",

      "28317\n",
      " No, of course not.\n",

      "28321\n",
      " Hey.\n",
      "28322\n",
      " Yeah, I’ll call you back.\n",
      "28323\n",
      " Look, I know you were just trying to help with your Star Wars thing. I didn’t mean to call it idiotic.\n",
      "28324\n",
      " Well, I don’t think you called it idiotic.\n",
      "28325\n",
      " Oh. Sorry, I meant to. Anyway, um, I was just upset with myself. I wasn’t mad at you. I just feel like everything is falling apart.\n",
      "28326\n",
      " Come on. It’s okay.\n",
      "28327\n",
      " No, it’s not okay. Look at me, okay? I took a temp job as a waitress forever ago, and I’m still doing it. I can’t quit, because guess what? I can’t do anything else. And I finally get my big break, and it goes away. I’m such a mess.\n",
      "28328\n",
      " No, you’re not.\n",
      "28329\n",
      " Really? ‘Cause this morning at Starbucks, a pair of old underwear fell out of my pant leg. And it wasn’t the only one in there.\n",
      "28330\n",
      " Okay, listen to me, this is just a minor setback.\n",
      "28331\n",
      " No, it’s not, okay? I’ve been out here for, like, ten years. I’ve nothing to show for it.\n",

      " Well, you have me.\n",
      "28333\n",

      "28476\n",
      " Oh, that’s terrible. What’s the address?\n",
      "28477\n",
      " Oh, thanks, but I don’twant you to close up. I mean, won’t you lose business? Sorry. That was mean.\n",

      "28482\n",
      " Well, do you support this?\n",
      "28483\n",

      "28489\n",
      " You got your job back. That is great news. I didn’t want to say anything, but you are making the right choice. To plunge yourself into debt right now would be literally insane.\n",

      "29092\n",

      " It is hideous.\n",
      "29094\n",

      "29099\n",
      " How do I know you’re not saying that as part of the manipulation?\n",
      "29100\n",
      " I think you’d be smart enough to see that, too.\n",
      "29101\n",
      " Okay. I’m sorry I gave you such a hard time, I just had to be sure.\n",
      "29102\n",
      " It’s pretty exciting that NASA wants to send Howard back up.\n",
      "29103\n",
      " Course.\n",
      "29104\n",
      " He hated that entire experience. Does it make me an awful wife if I don’t think he should do it again?\n",
      "29105\n",
      " Not at all. He’s forgotten how miserable he was the entire time he was up there. It’s like me in those moments when I miss India.\n",
      "29106\n",
      " So you’ll talk to him?\n",
      "29107\n",
      " Why me?\n",

      " Well, I’m his wife, I don’t want to ruin it for him.\n",

      "29111\n",

      "29121\n",
      " Yeah, okay, you can stop trying to make this about our relationship.\n",
      "29122\n",
      " Which is stronger than ever.\n",
      "29123\n",
      " Which is stronger than ever. This is about you trying to change my environment, which was perfect the way it was.\n",
      "29124\n",
      " But it got the way it was through change. The-the-the spot that you love to sit in, that no one else can sit in, only exists because, despite your objections. I bought this couch. Me. So explain why that change was bad and this change was good.\n",
      "29125\n",
      " Um.\n",
      "29126\n",
      " You don’t need to explain yourself to him.\n",

      " I think what we’re all trying to say is, you don’t seem to be remembering how traumatic the experience was for you.\n",
      "29143\n",
      " Like how women often forget the pain of childbirth.\n",
      "29144\n",

      " No, no, no. This is not a fight. I was just excited that someone offered you a part and a little surprised that you’d rather sit at home and do nothing than take it. Now it’s a fight.\n",
      "29216\n",
      " Well, with that sorted out, I’m happy to answer your question, Bernadette. Howard started it.\n",
      "29217\n",
      " I didn’t do anything. I was just sitting here.\n",
      "29218\n",
      " I wasn’t referring to this evening. Ten years ago, upon first seeing me, your husband claimed that I looked like C-3PO and Pee-wee Herman. And he called me C-3P-wee Herman.\n",
      "29219\n",
      " Ha-a-a. Still funny.\n",
      "29220\n",
      " That was ten years ago.\n",
      "29221\n",
      " Nine years, 11 months and three weeks ago, he followed that up by replacing the slides for my lecture with photographs of nude fat women bending over.\n",
      "29222\n",
      " Really?\n",
      "29223\n",
      " The lecture was on cosmic gas clouds. That’s funny.\n",
      "29224\n",
      " I was there. It was funny.\n",
      "29225\n",
      " In any event, that began a decade-long progression of insults, pranks and unwanted magazine subscriptions. To this day, I still get a monthly copy of Granny on Granny. Which, other than its surprisingly fun puzzle page, is complete filth.\n",
      "29226\n",
      " Thanks for walking me to my car.\n",
      "29227\n",
      " Actually, it’s for both of us. Last night, I watched West Side Story, and I’m a little freaked out by street gangs.\n",
      "29228\n",
      " Why can’t Raj find a girl? The mystery continues.\n",
      "29229\n",
      " I don’t appreciate your sarcasm, but we’ve still got two blocks to go, so I’ll put up with it.\n",
      "29230\n",
      " Whatever happened with your online dating?\n",
      "29231\n",
      " No one was writing me back, so I stopped checking my profile.\n",
      "29232\n",
      " Before I met Sheldon, I was ready to give up, too. Once, I even dropped in on my OBGYN just to get some human contact.\n",
      "29233\n",
      " It has been a while since I got my prostate checked.\n",
      "29234\n",
      " Then I met Sheldon and look at where we are now.\n",
      "29235\n",
      " What? You’ve kissed, like, once in three years.\n",
      "29236\n",
      " That’s true. Do whatever you want.\n",
      "29237\n",
      " Hey.\n",
      "29238\n",
      " Hello.\n",
      "29239\n",
      " Listen, I was thinking you and I could probably try to be better friends.\n",
      "29240\n",
      " Really? I was thinking what we have now is a bit much.\n",
      "29241\n",
      " Seriously, I was talking to Bernadette last night and she made some great points. You and I have known each other a long time, and I didn’t hear the rest ’cause she took her bra off.\n",
      "29242\n",
      " Very well. How do you propose we move forward?\n",
      "29243\n",
      " Uh, for starters, we could stop insulting each other.\n",
      "29244\n",
      " That’s a great idea. And in the spirit of our new arrangement, I will mask my surprise that you came up with it.\n",
      "29245\n",
      " Anyway, I got invited to do a little talk at NASA in Houston this weekend. They gave me two tickets. Bernadette can’t go. You want to come with me? You can visit your mom, and I’ll show you around the space centre.\n",
      "29246\n",
      " I have one question. Is this a prank where we land in Houston and you’ve made up wanted posters that have my face with a moustache and a Spanish name and then I get arrested and deported to South America?\n",
      "29247\n",
      " No.\n",
      "29248\n",
      " I’m glad because I would not have seen that coming.\n",
      "29249\n",
      " Amy, I could use some help.\n",
      "29250\n",
      " Oh. Let me guess. There’s an undergrad in a leather jacket snapping his fingers by the water fountain.\n",
      "29251\n",
      " I thought about what you said last night, and I went back on the dating Web site and I was looking at this girl’s profile. She’s amazing.\n",
      "29252\n",
      " Oh, she’s cute. And smart. Phi Beta Kappa.\n",
      "29253\n",
      " And judging by her lack of Adam’s apple, she’s been female her entire life. I like that in a woman.\n",
      "29254\n",
      " Great, so what do you need me for?\n",
      "29255\n",
      " Well, I was up all night trying to write to her, but I wanted to run it by you first.\n",
      "29256\n",
      " All right.\n",
      "29257\n",
      " Emily, your face is like a precious dew-kissed flower.\n",
      "29258\n",
      " Wow.\n",
      "29259\n",
      " I know. Powerful stuff, huh?\n",
      "29260\n",
      " No. You’re supposed to be yourself, not all desperate and creepy.\n",
      "29261\n",
      " Okay, I’m getting some mixed messages here.\n",
      "29262\n",
      " Just say something normal like, I saw your profile. Looks like we have a lot in common, let’s get a cup of coffee sometime.”\n",
      "29263\n",
      " Yes. Where I can be jealous of the cup touching your ruby lips. Or you just write it for me.\n",
      "29264\n",
      " I’m not gonna pretend to be you.\n",
      "29265\n",
      " I don’t want you to pretend to be me. You can be like my, uh, online wingman. Like if we met her at a bar and you talked me up.\n",
      "29266\n",
      " Well, what would I say to her?\n",
      "29267\n",
      " Just tell her what I’m really like. And, if you think it’ll help, that you saw me changing once and my package reminded you of the muscular tail of a jaguar. Use your own words.\n",
      "29268\n",
      " Thanks again for taking me to the pharmacy.\n",
      "29269\n",
      " Oh, it’s no problem. Is everything okay?\n",
      "29270\n",
      " Oh, I’m fine. It’s just some, uh, stomach medication for my trip. There’s the remote yet distinct possibility that I may end up in South America.\n",
      "29271\n",
      " Remember the old days when I would’ve said something dumb like why? Uh, that doesn’t sound good.\n",
      "29272\n",
      " Remember the old days when I used to point out that your check engine light was on?\n"

      " Like when?\n",
      "29344\n",
      " When? How about in the car? I’m an astronaut, and you know it. You just don’t like admitting it, because you’re jealous.\n",
      "29345\n",
      " Well, truth be told, as a child, I did dream of going to space. Those astronauts were my heroes. And when you got to go, it was hard for me.\n",
      "29346\n",
      " Thank you.\n",
      "29347\n",
      " Because it made me realize they’ll just send anyone up there. Aren’t you going to let me out?\n",

      "29351\n",
      " No, turbulence is just the equalization of diurnal temperature variations in the atmosphere. I’m not scared at all. Oh, apple juice, stay where you are.\n",
      "29352\n",
      " Oh, this is nothing. I experienced way worse when I was plummeting back to Earth, apparently not being a real astronaut. Okay, that was a big one.\n",
      "29353\n",
      " I take it back. I’m scared of turbulence!\n",
      "29354\n",

      "29355\n",
      " You sure you want to do this?\n",
      "29356\n",
      " Yeah. Why wouldn’t I want to get my old job back? It’ll be fun to see everyone. I haven’t talked to them since I said I quit, see you at the Oscars, bitches. Come on, let’s just get this over with.\n",
      "29357\n",
      " Let’s get this over with. Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory, or are we having sex? I’m just, I’m trying to lighten the mood.\n",
      "29358\n",
      " I know. Thank you.\n",
      "29359\n",
      " Sorry.\n",

      "29364\n",
      " I know. I thought we’d take yours.\n",
      "29365\n",
      " I don’t understand.\n",
      "29366\n",
      " It’s nothing fancy, but it’ll get you to auditions, and at least for now, you don’t have to go back to waitressing.\n",

      " I don’t know what to say.\n",
      "29368\n",

      "29369\n",
      " Oh, my God.\n",

      "29371\n",
      " Look, I admit that it’s odd that Rajesh didn’t write to you himself, but if you get to know him, you’ll see he’s just a sweet, regular guy. As a counterpoint, here he is, uninvited and visibly sweaty.\n",
      "29372\n",
      " Hello, Emily.\n",
      "29373\n",
      " Amy told me you were concerned that I might be too passive and shy. Let me ask you something. Would a passive guy barge in here to look you in the eye and say, hey, dew-kissed flower, what’s up?\n",
      "29374\n",
      " Uh, okay, that’s a separate issue. Let’s put a pin in that and just focus on the passive thing.\n",

      " Are we still going to go to that Chaucer reading Friday?\n",
      "29376\n",
      " Not my best first date. Yeah, but not my worst, either.\n",
      "29377\n",
      " I’m sorry for every mean thing I ever did or said to you.\n",
      "29378\n",
      " I’m sorry, too. It’s all my fault.\n",
      "29379\n",

      "29389\n",
      " I wouldn’t be so sure about that.\n",
      "29390\n",
      " Yeah, he has a very sensitive butt. Well, it’s true. Once I saw him sit on a bunch of loose change and add it up.\n",
      "29391\n",
      " Have you heard from Howard?\n",
      "29392\n",

      " Sheldon didn’t heckle him?\n",
      "29394\n",
      " No, in fact, he was so well-behaved, Howie bought him a Buzz Aldrin bobble head and astronaut ice cream.\n",

      "29489\n",

      "29497\n",
      " Hey, I won the Nobel Prize in physiology, then I used the money to buy Stuart’s comic book store, and close it down so Sheldon would pay attention to me. Not the worst idea.\n",

      " What does your card say, Bernadette?\n",
      "29504\n",
      " Uh, uh, uh, hang on. Do you think we’d really drift apart if we both became successful?\n",
      "29505\n",
      " Of course not. If I became a famous actress and had to move, you would just come with me.\n",

      "29508\n",

      "29509\n",
      " Speak for yourself. Last month, my company both invented and cured Restless Eye Syndrome. Ka-ching, ya blinky chumps.\n",

      " Yeah.\n",

      " Are you kidding me? This may be the biggest scientific breakthrough of our lifetime. How can you, as a theoretical physicist, not care about this?\n",
      "29794\n",
      " Maybe it’s because I’m not an elitist. What I’d like to know is, how does this gravity wave breakthrough help the man on the street? You know? Who’s looking out for Joe six-pack and all his quantum physics concerns?\n",
      "29795\n",
      " Oh, my God, you’re jealous.\n",
      "29796\n",
      " Why would I be jealous?\n",
      "29797\n",
      " Oh, I don’t know. Maybe because the origin of the universe just got proven, the Higgs field just got proven, and you’ve been working on string theory for the last 20 years and you’re no closer to proving it than when you started.\n",
      "29798\n",
      " Yeah, well, I’ve had a lot on my plate. We happen to live in a golden age of television.\n",
      "29799\n",
      " Really? Did they find evidence to support extra dimensions or supersymmetry?\n",
      "29800\n",
      " Why would you do that? You’re a string theorist as well.\n",
      "29801\n",
      " Do you think he’s right? Am I wasting my life on a theory that can never be proven?\n",
      "29802\n",
      " Maybe. But how great is Game of Thrones?\n",
      "29803\n",
      " Hey, you’re up early.\n",
      "29804\n",
      " I couldn’t sleep.\n",

      "29806\n",
      " No, that’s not it.\n",
      "29807\n",
      " Is something bothering you?\n",
      "29808\n",
      " Yes, but you wouldn’t understand.\n",
      "29809\n",
      " Oh, come on, try me.\n",
      "29810\n",
      " All right. I’ve devoted the prime of my life to string theory and its quest for the compactification of extra dimensions. I’ve got nothing to show for it, and I feel like a fool.\n",
      "29811\n",
      " Okay. I get it. I mean, not all the jibberjabber in the middle, but I know what it’s like to put your heart and soul into something and get nothing out of it.\n",
      "29812\n",
      " You mean your acting career?\n",
      "29813\n",
      " No.\n",
      "29814\n",
      " Your relationship with Leonard?\n",
      "29815\n",
      " No.\n",
      "29816\n",
      " Your failed attempt to go back to college?\n",
      "29817\n",
      " No. I’m saying you and string theory sound like a relationship, and I know what it’s like to be in one and realize it’s never gonna turn out the way you want.\n",
      "29818\n",
      " I said Leonard, you said no.\n",
      "29819\n",
      " I’m talking about other guys.\n",
      "29820\n",
      " Okay. Well, what do you do?\n",
      "29821\n",
      " You have to have the courage to end the relationship. You know? Break it off, shake hands, walk away.\n",
      "29822\n",
      " I don’t know if I can do that.\n",
      "29823\n",
      " I know it’s hard, honey, but in the end, that’s how you grow.\n",
      "29824\n",
      " Penny, have you seen my good inhaler?\n",
      "29825\n",
      " Break it off, shake hands, walk away.\n",
      "29826\n",
      " Hey, how’s dating two women going?\n",
      "29827\n",
      " Um, kind of hit a bump. When I was honest and told Emily she wasn’t the only person I was seeing, it went great. So I tried the same thing with Lucy.\n",
      "29828\n",
      " And?\n",
      "29829\n",
      " She had mixed feelings. But when I said, Emily was cool with it. Emily’s the best. Why can’t you\n",
      "29830\n",
      " Women. Who knows what’ll set ’em off?\n",
      "29831\n",
      " At least now I can focus all my energies on just one girl.\n",
      "29832\n",
      " I hope I get to meet her as soon as possible.\n",
      "29833\n",
      " Why the rush? She isn’t going anywhere.\n",
      "29834\n",
      " She is. But I like that attitude.\n",
      "29835\n",
      " Gentlemen, is anybody interested in my old string theory books?\n",
      "29836\n",
      " You’re really going to do this?\n",
      "29837\n",
      " I am. Yeah, Penny pointed out that what I’m going through is essentially a breakup. And according to Cosmopolitan magazine, one of the most effective techniques for moving on is to get rid of all reminders of the relationship.\n",
      "29838\n",
      " You’re reading Cosmo?\n",
      "29839\n",
      " Yes. As it turns out, there’s an article on how to get over a breakup in literally every issue. Anyway, it suggests that I set these on fire, but the smell of burning books reminds me of church picnics in East Texas.\n",
      "29840\n",
      " What’s this?\n",
      "29841\n",
      " Oh, that’s just a doodle of a hyperelliptic Riemann surface.\n",
      "29842\n",
      " Oh, yeah. Wasn’t that the basis of your postdoc fellowship?\n",
      "29843\n",
      " It was. This seemed so elegant at the time, but now I realize I was just a simple country boy seduced by a big city theory with variables in all the right places.\n",
      "29844\n",
      " It’s going to be okay.\n",
      "29845\n",
      " I know. As hard as this is, I have to move on. I can’t keep postulating multidimensional entities and get nothing in return. I have needs, too.\n",
      "29846\n",
      " So, you and Emily still together?\n",
      "29847\n",
      " I spoke to Bernadette. She’s free tomorrow night.\n",
      "29848\n",
      " Oh, okay, great. But if we’re really gonna do a double date, then we have to go over some ground rules about Emily.\n",
      "29849\n",
      " Like when it turns out she’s made of rubber, I don’t say anything?\n",
      "29850\n",
      " She’s very real.\n",
      "29851\n",
      " Oh, that’s what it says on the box. Right next to dishwasher safe.\n",
      "29852\n",
      " See? This is exactly the kind of thing I’m worried about you saying in front of her.\n",
      "29853\n",
      " I promise I’ll be on my best behaviour.\n",
      "29854\n",
      " You better be. No jokes about how close I am with my dog. Or the truth about how close I am with my dog.\n",
      "29855\n",
      " You got it.\n",
      "29856\n",
      " No jokes about the year I took ballet.\n",
      "29857\n",
      " You took ballet?\n",
      "29858\n",
      " God, you never listen.\n",
      "29859\n",
      " Are you sure you want to do this?\n",
      "29860\n",
      " The magazine articles suggest that one of the ways to get over a breakup is a new look.\n",
      "29861\n",
      " What about your old look, well-groomed ventriloquist doll?\n",
      "29862\n",
      " You stop it.\n",
      "29863\n",
      " So, how do you want me to cut it?\n",
      "29864\n",
      " Oh, how about Bill Gates meets Nikola Tesla?\n",
      "29865\n",
      " So, business in the front, science in the back.\n",
      "29866\n",
      " Or I don’t cut it and maybe just style it a little.\n",
      "29867\n",
      " Oh, I’m in your hands. Do a good job and I’ll tell you Cosmo’s ten dynamite tips to enjoy your PMS.\n",
      "29868\n",
      " Can you keep him quiet? Maybe jangle some keys in front of him?\n",
      "29869\n",
      " That doesn’t work any more. He just thinks I’m taking him to the doctor. So, now that you’re no longer invested in string theory, what are you gonna pursue?\n",
      "29870\n",
      " Oh, there are so many exciting areas. Black holes, dark matter.\n",
      "29871\n",
      " Oh, Leonard was telling me about dark matter, but I didn’t really understand it.\n",
      "29872\n",
      " Don’t feel bad. Neither does he.\n",
      "29873\n",
      " Okay, what do you think?\n",
      "29874\n",
      " Have you ever even seen a picture of Tesla?\n",

      " Doesn’t it?\n",
      "29877\n",
      " Yeah.\n",
      "29878\n",
      " I suppose I could see myself in a scientific boy band. Of course, I’d be the dreamy one and the smart one.\n",
      "29879\n",
      " Sorry I’m late. What did you do?\n",
      "29880\n",
      " I gave him a new look. It’s cute, huh?\n",
      "29881\n",
      " Yeah, it’s cute. That’s the problem. I don’t need other girls to see him walking around like sex on a stick.\n",
      "29882\n",
      " She’s right. I’m too hot.\n",
      "29883\n",

      "29884\n",
      " Me, too. I just hope he doesn’t blow it.\n",
      "29885\n",
      " Why would you say that?\n",
      "29886\n",
      " Because he’s Raj, that’s his thing. Beckham can bend it, Ralph can wreck it, Raj can blow it. Look, I don’t want it to happen, but odds are he’s gonna find a way to… Oh, crap, I know that girl.\n",
      "29887\n",

      " Wait. What’s wrong with geology?\n",
      "29901\n",
      " Let me put this in a way you’ll understand, Penny. You remember how you explained to me that the Kardashians aren’t real celebrities? Well, geology is the Kardashians of science.\n",
      "29902\n",
      " Have you considered studying standard model physics?\n",
      "29903\n",

      "29914\n",

      "29915\n",

      " Your heart might be in the right place, but your head, chest and arms certainly aren’t.\n",
      "30176\n",

      "30177\n",
      " But, that’s Star Wars Day.\n",
      "30178\n",
      " Yeah, um, of all the things about this that are sad, that might not be number one. You okay? I know he meant a lot to you.\n",
      "30179\n",
      " I’m fine.\n",
      "30180\n",
      " Okay. Yet he cried when they changed the Raisin Bran box.\n",
      "30181\n",
      " Watching your old friend?\n",
      "30182\n",
      " Hmm. Yes. Look at him, Amy. It’s such a shame. Struck down in the prime of my life.\n",
      "30183\n",
      " Do you want me to go to the funeral with you?\n",
      "30184\n",

      "30185\n",
      " Why not?\n",
      "30186\n",
      " All those people blowing their noses. You can’t tell the sick from the sad. Mm. I’ll be at home celebrating Star Wars Day, as planned.\n",
      "30187\n",
      " Are you sure you don’t want to go say good-bye?\n",
      "30188\n",
      " Amy, mourning the inevitable is a complete waste of time.\n",
      "30189\n",
      " And watching a bunch of goofy space movies you’ve seen hundreds of times isn’t?\n",
      "30190\n",
      " If we were in a physical relationship, you just lost sex tonight.\n",
      "30191\n",
      " Hey, guys.\n",
      "30192\n",
      " Hey, Penny. Happy Star Wars Day.\n",
      "30193\n",
      " Okay.\n",
      "30194\n",
      " Can I make you breakfast? Admiral Ackbar’s Snack Bar is open for business.\n",
      "30195\n",
      " No, thanks. Leonard and I are just going to the funeral.\n",
      "30196\n",
      " You sure. Not even coffee? We have R2-Decaf. Maybe a nice Cafe Au Leia?\n",
      "30197\n",
      " And if you’re not in the mood for coffee I can always make you a Chai Tea-3PO.\n",
      "30198\n",
      " Oh, I get it, like C3PO. What happened to me?\n",
      "30199\n",
      " Hey, uh, Sheldon, you want anything?\n",
      "30200\n",
      " Uh, no, thank you.\n",
      "30201\n",
      " You’re being so quiet. Are you upset or are you just rebooting?\n",
      "30202\n",
      " I’m fine.\n",
      "30203\n",
      " Sweetie, are you sure you don’t want to come with us to the funeral?\n",
      "30204\n",
      " Oh, I appreciate the offer, but Arthur is gone and there’s nothing I can do about it. When Darth Vader struck down Obi-Wan, did Luke cry like a baby and go to his funeral?\n",
      "30205\n",
      " No, he blew up the Death Star. Why do I know this?\n",
      "30206\n",
      " Arthur Jeffries was a scientist. I’m sure he didn’t care about silly superstitions like funerals. You know, if he were here, I think he’d say enjoy Star Wars Day.\n",
      "30207\n",
      " He was 84, he’d say where’s my pudding?\n",
      "30208\n",
      " Before you go, at least let me pack you some Attack of the Scones for the road.\n",
      "30209\n",
      " Oh, like Attack of the Clones. We are leaving right now.\n",
      "30210\n",
      " Arthur passing away was harder on Sheldon than he’s ready to admit. Really hoping this will cheer him up.\n",
      "30211\n",
      " Me, too. Although, it might’ve been thoughtless of us to bake a Death Star cake.\n",
      "30212\n",
      " No, it combines two of Sheldon’s favorite things, chocolate chips and the ability to destroy a planet at the push of a button.\n",
      "30213\n",
      " Well, anyway, it’ll be a nice surprise for the boys. And Howie doesn’t think I take his interests seriously, so hopefully this will keep him fooled for a while.\n",
      "30214\n",
      " Okay, let’s get the fondant and start decorating.\n",
      "30215\n",
      " This is pretty cool. You don’t see too many spherical cakes.\n",
      "30216\n",
      " I wonder why that is.\n",
      "30217\n",
      " I have a confession to make.\n",
      "30218\n",
      " Hmm?\n",
      "30219\n",
      " I’ve never been to a funeral before.\n",
      "30220\n",
      " Really?\n",
      "30221\n",
      " I just never knew anyone that died. I had a pet pig when I was a kid. I mean, when he died, we didn’t have a funeral, we had a barbecue.\n",
      "30222\n",
      " Yeah, we won’t be eating Arthur tonight.\n",
      "30223\n",
      " I didn’t know him very well, but I still really liked him. It’s weird that he’s just gone.\n",
      "30224\n",
      " I know.\n",
      "30225\n",
      " I feel like I want to cry.\n",
      "30226\n",
      " Oh that’s, that’s fine. Go ahead.\n",
      "30227\n",
      " I can’t do it with you staring at me.\n",
      "30228\n",
      " Sorry.\n",
      "30229\n",
      " No, I’m dry. You’re a big crybaby, you start, I’ll join in.\n",
      "30230\n",
      " I am not a crybaby.\n",
      "30231\n",
      " Toy Story 3?\n",
      "30232\n",
      " The toys were holding hands in a furnace. Look, Arthur lived a full life. And he inspired a lot of people. Sure, he, he was my childhood hero, but the fact that I got to work with him, side by side, before he died was, it was, it was a gift.\n",
      "30233\n",
      " It was a gift. Thank you for being the emotional one in this relationship.\n",
      "30234\n",
      " I got your back.\n",
      "30235\n",
      " Yeah.\n",
      "30236\n",
      " Okay, here we go. Episode I: The Phantom Menace.\n",
      "30237\n",
      " Ugh, let’s get this over with.\n",
      "30238\n",
      " Since we all agree Episode I isn’t our favourite, maybe we just skip it this time.\n",
      "30239\n",
      " Howard, I think you of all people should avoid espousing the principle that if something is not our favourite we should just get rid of it.\n",
      "30240\n",
      " You know, I heard of this way of watching the movies called the Machete Order, where you watch Episodes IV and V, then skip Episode I, watch II and III as a flashback, and then finish with VI.\n",
      "30241\n",
      " Okay, so you’d lose most of Jar Jar, all the trade route talk and the boring senate hearings, which are like watching C-SPAN with monsters.\n",
      "30242\n",
      " Get rid of the trade route part? Then how would Palpatine get Chancellor Valorum kicked out of office? How would he get himself elected? How? Can we get through one holiday without you saying something ridiculous?\n",
      "30243\n",
      " It was just a suggestion.\n",
      "30244\n",
      " Well, you know what else was just a suggestion? Why don’t we change the Raisin Bran box? Hmm? And you know who got hurt by that? Every single person who eats breakfast.\n",
      "30245\n",
      " Wow.\n",
      "30246\n",
      " I think he’s taking this Professor Proton thing pretty hard.\n",
      "30247\n",
      " Should we try to console him?\n",
      "30248\n",
      " Or should we respect his privacy in this moment of grief?\n",
      "30249\n",
      " By staying here and watching the movie.\n",
      "30250\n",
      " That’s what good friends would do.\n",
      "30251\n",
      " Well, at least without Sheldon here, we got to start with Episode IV.\n",
      "30252\n",
      " Mm, true. I do feel guilty about him.\n",
      "30253\n",
      " Me, too.\n",
      "30254\n",
      " Maybe we should see how he’s doing.\n",
      "30255\n",
      " Yeah.\n",
      "30256\n",
      " But after the cantina scene.\n",
      "30257\n",
      " Obviously.\n",
      "30258\n",
      " Look at Arthur, cracking up at a joke I told him. I’ll never hear that laugh again.\n",
      "30259\n",
      " Arthur. I thought you were dead.\n",
      "30260\n",
      " Why are you here?\n",
      "30261\n",
      " I know why. You’ve come to me because you’re my Obi-Wan.\n",
      "30262\n",
      " Wow. Uh, you’re dead, so I’m going to let that slide. Obi-Wan Kenobi is a character from Star Wars. After his physical demise, he comes to Luke Skywalker as his mentor in spirit form.\n",
      "30263\n",
      " You must be here to give me advice.\n",
      "30264\n",
      " Those are your Jedi robes.\n",
      "30265\n",
      " Be careful with that.\n",
      "30266\n",
      " So, what did you think of your first funeral?\n",
      "30267\n",
      " Well, I don’t want to be a jerk, but it was kind of a bummer.\n",
      "30268\n",
      " Yeah, well, when I die, you can rent a bounce house.\n",
      "30269\n",
      " You think about dying?\n",
      "30270\n",
      " Mm. Well, I think more about if I’d have any regrets.\n",
      "30271\n",
      " What would you regret?\n",
      "30272\n",
      " Mm, you know, that I didn’t travel more, take more risks, learn another language.\n",
      "30273\n",
      " You know Klingon.\n",
      "30274\n",
      " That’s true.\n",
      "30275\n",
      " No, I meant that as a regret.\n",
      "30276\n",
      " I just thought of one more.\n",
      "30277\n",
      " What’s that?\n",
      "30278\n",

      "30280\n",
      " Yeah.\n",

      " What?\n",
      "30283\n",
      " I know that face. That’s your propose face.\n",

      " I was not gonna propose. It’s already two to one.\n",
      "30285\n",
      " What’s two to one?\n",
      "30286\n",
      " I proposed twice, you proposed once. Two to one.\n",
      "30287\n",
      " Oh, my. It’s not a contest.\n",
      "30288\n",
      " I don’t know what you’re upset about. I’m the one who’s losing.\n",
      "30289\n",
      " Okay. Fine. Would you feel better if I propose so you could turn me down again?\n",
      "30290\n",
      " Yeah, I think I would.\n",
      "30291\n",

      "30292\n",
      " Hmm.\n",

      " No, don’t you dare. You reject me right now and tie things up.\n",
      "30294\n",
      " It’s just such a big decision. I don’t want to have any regrets.\n",
      "30295\n",
      " Did you ever watch Professor Proton when you were a kid?\n",
      "30296\n",
      " No. My dad controlled the TV, so unless someone was a Texas Ranger, Jake or the Fatman, we didn’t see it.\n",
      "30297\n",
      " I never watched him, either, but he seems to be the reason that Sheldon got interested in science.\n",
      "30298\n",
      " Not me. I got into science ’cause I was always the smallest kid in school, so I thought if I became a scientist, I could invent a formula that made me taller.\n",
      "30299\n",
      " That’s cute.\n",
      "30300\n",

      " You don’t have to make me anything.\n",
      "30419\n",

      " Sorry, I left them in my turban.\n",
      "30421\n",

      " Wouldn’t you be upset if you saw Amy out with someone else?\n",
      "30423\n",

      " I’d love to. I’m just about to do yoga with Penny.\n",
      "30766\n",

      " Oh, my God, are you okay?\n",
      "30768\n",

      " Okay. Uh, I’ll, I’ll come get you. What’s the address?\n",

      " 2530 East Andy Devine Avenue,\n",
      "30774\n",
      " Okay.\n",
      "30775\n",
      " Hurry.\n",
      "30776\n",
      " Sheldon, hang tight. Hey, do you want me to bring anything?\n",
      "30777\n",
      " Oh, yes, please. A pair of pants. And my toothbrush. Yeah, and my mail. And a really good comeback for chicken legs, because “I know you are, but what am I?” was met with stony silence.\n",
      "30778\n",
      " I’ll be there as soon as I can.\n",
      "30779\n",
      " Is he okay?\n",
      "30780\n",
      " Yeah, he’s fine, he’s just a little rattled.\n",
      "30781\n",
      " Oh.\n",
      "30782\n",
      " Feel like driving to Arizona with me?\n",
      "30783\n",
      " I can’t, I have that job interview.\n",
      "30784\n",
      " Oh, right.\n",
      "30785\n",
      " Besides, I don’t need six hours of your hair is different, why did you change your hair? I’m holding my breath until your hair grows back.\n",
      "30786\n",
      " All right, fine. Hey, can you think of a reason I shouldn’t invite Amy to come with me?\n",
      "30787\n",
      " Nope.\n",
      "30788\n",
      " Come on, you didn’t even try.\n",
      "30789\n",
      " Thanks for the lift.\n",
      "30790\n",
      " What’s wrong with your car?\n",
      "30791\n",
      " I’m having my windows untinted.\n",
      "30792\n",
      " Why?\n",
      "30793\n",
      " Got a hot girlfriend now. I want the haters to know.\n",
      "30794\n",
      " What are you talking about? No one’s paying attention to you.\n",
      "30795\n",
      " Wow. How’s that Hater-Ade taste, bro? Hey, this isn’t the way to work.\n",
      "30796\n",
      " I just want to pop in and make sure Ma’s okay.\n",
      "30797\n",
      " I thought Stuart was looking after her.\n",
      "30798\n",
      " He was, but now that her cast is off, he moved out. And honestly, I’m kind of glad. It was getting a little weird.\n",
      "30799\n",
      " How so?\n",
      "30800\n",
      " I don’t know, they’re, chummy.\n",
      "30801\n",
      " Like us?\n",
      "30802\n",
      " No, not like us. Creepy chummy, like you and your dog.\n",
      "30803\n",
      " She feeds him out of her own mouth?\n",
      "30804\n",
      " I mean, he calls her Debbie, she calls him Stewie and they’re all giggly around each other. And believe me, when food goes in that mouth, it does not come out.\n",
      "30805\n",
      " So are you worried because he’s replacing you as a son or are you worried because he’s becoming her lover?\n",
      "30806\n",
      " First of all, no one can replace me as a son. I’m her little matzo ball. And secondly, my mother is well past having any kind of sex life.\n",
      "30807\n",
      " Okay, okay. Although many older women lead vibrant, active…\n",
      "30808\n",
      " I said well past it.\n",
      "30809\n",
      " Excuse me, Officer Hernandez? Any leads on the person who stole my belongings?\n",
      "30810\n",
      " Well, perhaps I can help. Sherlock Holmes always says when you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, have, have you tried doing that?\n",
      "30811\n",
      " Well, maybe you should. There’s lots of books called Sherlock Holmes, and there’s no books called Officer Hernandez.\n",
      "30812\n",
      " Thanks again for coming. Six hours was gonna be a long drive by myself.\n",
      "30813\n",
      " My pleasure. And I’m not angry at all that my boyfriend was in trouble and called you instead of me. I love that,\n",
      "30814\n",
      " Yeah, time’s gonna fly by.\n",
      "30815\n",
      " I haven’t been on a job interview in years. I’m really nervous.\n",
      "30816\n",

      "30817\n",
      " I don’t have any experience in sales. Unless you count the bikini car wash I did in high school. But you already made me take that off my résumé.\n",
      "30818\n",
      " This job is a lot like being a waitress, except instead of pushing the fish tacos ’cause they’re about to go bad, you’re just pushing our antidepressants before the FDA finds out they may cause rectal bleeding.\n",
      "30819\n",
      " They do?\n",
      "30820\n",
      " Maybe. But like our lawyers say, the world is full of things that can cause a rectum to bleed. Anyway, I talked you up to Dan. He’s the guy who’ll be interviewing you.\n",
      "30821\n",
      " Oh, I really appreciate this. I just hope I’m not in over my head.\n",
      "30822\n",
      " You’ll be fine. Just be yourself.\n",
      "30823\n",
      " I wish I felt more confident.\n",
      "30824\n",
      " Penny, I wouldn’t have put you up for this job if I didn’t think you could handle it.\n",
      "30825\n",
      " Oh, thank you, but maybe I should cancel.\n",
      "30826\n",
      " It’s too late to cancel. You’re going.\n",
      "30827\n",
      " But I don’t know anything about pharmaceuticals.\n",
      "30828\n",
      " Oh, I understand. You want to do something you’re already good at. I know. Why don’t I get you a job at the Sitting Around All Day Wearing Yoga Pants Factory?\n",
      "30829\n",
      " They’re comfortable.\n",
      "30830\n",
      " Ma, I hope you’re decent. Raj is here. You just started seeing naked women again, and I don’t want you to be confused about where the boobs should be.\n",
      "30831\n",
      " Uh, what are you doing here? I thought you moved out.\n",
      "30832\n",
      " It’s not that precious.\n",
      "30833\n",
      " I’d like to back you up, but it sounds like it was pretty precious.\n",
      "30834\n",
      " Or in her neck. Listen. You staying here seems like something she would’ve talked to me about.\n",

      "30912\n",
      " Exactly. Right after they said yeah.\n",

      "30914\n",
      " That’s a good point. You know, I’m a lot like Gandalf the Grey. He fought the Balrog and emerged stronger than ever as Gandalf the White. I was robbed of my phone and pants, and I, too, came back stronger. And whiter, too, ’cause I wasn’t in direct sunlight for six weeks.\n",

      " (Knock, knock, knock) That’s right, good job. Hello. Uh, you wanted to see me?\n",
      "30955\n",
      " Thank you. I assume you’d like to reopen our dialogue about the university forcing me to continue with string theory?\n",
      "30956\n",
      " That’s the one. I believe you went last, so, uh, please?\n",
      "30957\n",
      " Wow. Pouting and running away actually worked. I must say, that may not be a lesson you want to reinforce with me. So, um, what is the solution?\n",
      "30958\n",
      " But if I’m a professor, then I’ll have to teach a class.\n",
      "30959\n",
      " So your solution is to promote me and pay me more money so that I can impart my knowledge to the next generation of scientists?\n",

      " Well, you saw her the other night. Am I wrong?\n",
      "30974\n",
      " No, I just, I feel kind of uncomfortable talking about her like this. Usually when someone’s being talked about behind their back, it’s me and it’s right in front of my face.\n",
      "30975\n",
      " I’m sorry. I just need a little break from her.\n",
      "30976\n",

      " Why is it your last name and her first name?\n",

      " Hey, how’d it go with human resources?\n",
      "30983\n",
      " Awful. They’re allowing me to move on from string theory, but they made me a junior professor and are requiring me to teach a class.\n",
      "30984\n",

      " This might not be that bad. Uh, you like telling people they’re wrong.\n",
      "30989\n",

      "31003\n",
      " I do, I see it.\n",
      "31004\n",
      " It’s driving me crazy. Just this afternoon, I saw on Instagram that instead of studying, she went out to lunch and got a manicure.\n",
      "31005\n",
      " That’s outrageous.\n",
      "31006\n",

      " If she doesn’t do well, this could reflect poorly on you.\n",

      " Exactly. Does she not realize it or does she not care?\n",
      "31009\n",
      " I don’t know. The important thing is I am here for you so we can mutually disparage this unpleasing third party.\n",

      "31017\n",
      " Hey, Sheldon, I’m sorry.\n",

      " Aw, you brought cookies for everyone?\n",
      "31020\n",
      " Oh, yes. Fig Newtons. I was going to ask them which scientist both helped to develop calculus and had a famous cookie named after him? And then after someone said Newton, I was going to tell them they’re wrong. The cookies are named after a town in Massachusetts. And then I’d throw the cookies away.\n",

      "31028\n",

      "31034\n",
      " I’d use Feynman’s trick, differentiate under the integral sign.\n",
      "31035\n",
      " Okay. Um, what is the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics?\n",
      "31036\n",
      " Since every interpretation gives exactly the same answer to every measurement, they are all equally correct. However, I know you believe in the Many Worlds Interpretation, so I’ll say that. Now do you think I’m smart enough?\n",
      "31037\n",
      " No.\n",
      "31038\n",
      " Oh, come on. You might’ve gone to school for a couple more years than me, but guess what, engineers are just as smart as physicists.\n",

That little voice was right, but then I remembered that I’m not an athlete. I’m a scientist. So, today’s first pitch will be delivered to home plate by science. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, I present to you a working prototype of the Mars Rover. And here’s the wind-up, and the pitch.\n"

      "31334\n",
      " Hello.\n",
      "31335\n",
      " We still on for tomorrow night?\n",
      "31336\n",
      " Yeah. I’m excited to finally meet your girlfriend.\n",
      "31337\n",
      " Speaking of which, according to a recent study out of Oxford University, when someone takes on a new romantic partner, that person loses one or two close friends.\n",
      "31338\n",
      " Since when do you read social science?\n",
      "31339\n",
      " I go to the bathroom like everybody else.\n",
      "31340\n",
      " Why would I lose friends just because I started dating someone?\n",
      "31341\n",
      " Yeah, you didn’t lose anyone when you met Amy. Yeah, well, no, this study refers to romantic partners. Not the way I would categorize the two of us.\n",
      "31342\n",
      " You guys kiss and hold hands.\n",
      "31343\n",
      " I’ve seen him do it. It’s not romantic.\n",
      "31344\n",
      " Look, I’m not the kind of guy who drops his friends just because he’s in a relationship.\n",
      "31345\n",
      " What happens if she doesn’t like us?\n",
      "31346\n",
      " Well, hey, you’re my dear friends. You’ll get a Christmas card for a couple of years, and then you’re dead to me.\n",
      "31347\n",
      " So, Howard, is Stuart still living with your mom?\n",
      "31348\n",
      " I don’t want to talk about it.\n",
      "31349\n",
      " But he’s going to.\n",
      "31350\n",
      " My mom got him cable. In my whole life, growing up in that house, no cable. Do you know how many HBOs that leech had my mother get him? Seven. Seven HBOs. Seven.\n",
      "31351\n",
      " Long story short, they have seven HBOs.\n",
      "31352\n",
      " Hey, guys.\n",
      "31353\n",
      " Hello.\n",
      "31354\n",
      " Emily, you know almost everybody here.\n",
      "31355\n",
      " And this is Leonard, this is Penny.\n",
      "31356\n",
      " Nice to finally meet you, too.\n",
      "31357\n",
      " Hi.\n",
      "31358\n",
      " Wow, Raj, you were not lying about her.\n",
      "31359\n",
      " I told you she exists.\n",
      "31360\n",
      " Hey, I hear you’re a dermatologist.\n",
      "31361\n",
      " Oh, I like their emergency room. Yeah, even if it turns out you don’t have Dengue fever, they still let you take a lollipop.\n",
      "31362\n",
      " You know, Penny just started training to be a pharmaceutical sales rep. Maybe she can practice on you some time.\n",
      "31363\n",
      " Oh, it would be great to practice on a real doctor.\n",
      "31364\n",
      " I have some odd freckles on my buttocks. Can I make an appointment for you to look at them?\n",
      "31365\n",
      " I’m with him three years, nothing. She’s with him two minutes, and he’s taking his pants off.\n",
      "31366\n",
      " Last night was fun. What did you think of Emily?\n",
      "31367\n",
      " I don’t know. I kind of got the sense she didn’t like me.\n",
      "31368\n",
      " Did she say she didn’t like you?\n",
      "31369\n",
      " Of course not. No one ever says they don’t like you straight to your face.\n",
      "31370\n",
      " We have led different lives.\n",
      "31371\n",
      " You guys just met. Why would she feel that way?\n",
      "31372\n",
      " It’s just this vibe I got.\n",
      "31373\n",
      " I’m sure you’re worried about nothing.\n",
      "31374\n",
      " Yeah. You’re probably right. I used to think my high school P.E. teacher didn’t like me, but it turned out, she liked me a little too much.\n",
      "31375\n",
      " Really?\n",
      "31376\n",
      " Yeah. It was fine. We went to a Melissa Etheridge concert, I got an A, it all worked out.\n",
      "31377\n",
      " When you go to Emily’s office to practice, you’ll see. It’s fine.\n",
      "31378\n",
      " Yeah, I hope you’re right.\n",
      "31379\n",
      " You really went your entire life without anyone saying I hate you to your face?\n",
      "31380\n",
      " Yeah.\n",
      "31381\n",
      " I’d say it now, but look at those cheekbones.\n",
      "31382\n",
      " I miss Stuart’s place. All this loud music and exposed brick. What, is this a comic book store, or a rave at the third little pig’s house?\n",
      "31383\n",
      " Yep, I wish Stuart would reopen. I hate this place, too.\n",
      "31384\n",
      " Okay, him I believe because he’s an 80-year-old man in a 15-year-old’s tee shirt. But you’re just upset about Stuart and your mom and all their HBOs.\n",
      "31385\n",
      " Yes, I am. You know, I can’t even watch Game of Thrones now without thinking of mother saying, Stuart, which one is Thrones?\n",
      "31386\n",
      " You know, he might not reopen. He didn’t get a lot of money from the insurance company.\n",
      "31387\n",
      " Oh, boy, if there is one thing that gets my goat, it’s those dad-gum insurance companies.\n",
      "31388\n",
      " Why? Because they won’t get off your lawn? Is Stuart trying to get a loan, or, or find investors?\n",
      "31389\n",
      " All I know is, he’s got my mother buying four-ply toilet paper. I mean, four-ply. If his butt is so delicate, why doesn’t he just use an angora rabbit?\n",
      "31390\n",
      " For starters, they shed and bite.\n",
      "31391\n",
      " Hey, here’s a thought. Why don’t we put up the rest of the money that Stuart needs?\n",
      "31392\n",
      " So, we’d be, like, owners of a comic book store?\n",
      "31393\n",
      " It’s kind of a dream come true.\n",
      "31394\n",
      " That does sound fun.\n",
      "31395\n",
      " Ooh, maybe we could come up with a business plan to compete with this place.\n",
      "31396\n",
      " I’ll give you a plan right now. Step one, open comic book store. Step two, start rumour this comic book store gives you genital warts. Step three, buy a big bag to put the money in.\n",
      "31397\n",
      " It’s not that bad.\n",
      "31398\n",
      " Hey.\n",
      "31399\n",
      " Thank you so much for letting me practice my sales pitch on you. I really appreciate it.\n",
      "31400\n",
      " Um, I brought coffee. I wasn’t sure what you like, so I got a regular, a cappuccino and a Chai tea. Since you like Raj, I thought you might be into that.\n",
      "31401\n",
      " Oh, yeah, sure. Let me just get out my materials. Leonard gave me this briefcase. He used to carry it around in high school. You can still see the dent where they whacked him with it. Okay, I would like to talk to you about our new birth control pill, Femevra.\n",
      "31402\n",
      " So, Femevra’s triphasic design provides balanced hormonal exposure.\n",
      "31403\n",
      " It has also been shown to cause significantly fewer side effects than other oral contraceptives. Although it can cause acne, which, if you ask me, kind of increases its effectiveness as a contraceptive.\n",
      "31404\n",
      " Okay, I’m sorry. Did we get off on the wrong foot? Because since the other night, I kind of feel like you might have a problem with me.\n",
      "31405\n",
      " Are you sure, because it doesn’t seem fine?\n",
      "31406\n",
      " Oh, my God. Tell me, what did I do?\n",
      "31407\n",
      " What? Oh, why would he say that?\n",
      "31408\n",
      " Well, I wouldn’t exactly call it a hook-up.\n",
      "31409\n",
      " Yeah.\n",
      "31410\n",
      " Yeah.\n",
      "31411\n",
      " No. Yeah.\n",
      "31412\n",
      " So, what are some ways we could set our comic book store apart from the competition?\n",
      "31413\n",
      " Oh, kids buy comic books. It would be great to figure out a way to get more kids in the store.\n",
      "31414\n",
      " You know, when I was a kid, I loved going there, but I could never get a ride.\n",
      "31415\n",
      " Ooh, what if we got a van and drove around and picked kids up?\n",
      "31416\n",
      " Nice. You mean, like at parks and schools?\n",
      "31417\n",
      " Toy stores, puppet shows.\n",
      "31418\n",
      " Hold on. So, your idea is to get a van and cruise the streets looking for kids to pick up?\n",
      "31419\n",
      " Yes.\n",
      "31420\n",
      " And are you gonna use candy to lure them in?\n",
      "31421\n",
      " We are now.\n",
      "31422\n",
      " You told Emily we hooked up?\n",
      "31423\n",
      " Um, well, in my defence, I tell everybody.\n",
      "31424\n",
      " Why would you say that?\n",
      "31425\n",
      " We were having a conversation about past lovers.\n",
      "31426\n",
      " We weren’t lovers. Come on. Everyone knows we didn’t sleep together. We got drunk and fooled around. Why couldn’t you just leave me out of it?\n",
      "31427\n",
      " Well, we were being honest. You would leave me out of the conversation with the next guy if you dumped Leonard?\n",
      "31428\n",
      " Why say it?\n",
      "31429\n",
      " Yes.\n",
      "31430\n",
      " Well, I would never leave you off my list, and not just because, without you, we’re playing fast and loose with the word list.\n",
      "31431\n",
      " Well, good job. Now she hates me. Ugh.\n",
      "31432\n",
      " Great.\n",
      "31433\n",
      " On the bright side, that Oxford study was right. One friend down. I wonder who you’re going to lose next.\n",
      "31434\n",
      " You, okay? It’s you. You’re, you’re next.\n",
      "31435\n",
      " No. You’re crazy about me.\n",
      "31436\n",
      " I don’t know what Emily’s so upset about anyway. Even if I had slept with him, so what? Everyone has a past.\n",
      "31437\n",
      " Hmm-hmm.\n",
      "31438\n",
      " Almost everyone has a past.\n",
      "31439\n",
      " Come on, look how pretty you are. I’m sure this isn’t the first girl to hate you.\n",
      "31440\n",
      " It’s not.\n",
      "31441\n",
      " And I’m sure you can turn it around.\n",
      "31442\n",
      " How? You can’t force someone to like you.\n",
      "31443\n",
      " What if you just hang around and act like her friend until you wear her down? I mean, next thing you know, you’re in her home, you’re eating her food, drinking her wine.\n",
      "31444\n",
      " No, that won’t work.\n",
      "31445\n",
      " You’re right. Cheers.\n",
      "31446\n",
      " Oh, I know. Why don’t you use your sales training to go back down there and sell yourself?\n",
      "31447\n",
      " What?\n",
      "31448\n",
      " Yeah. But instead of selling a drug, you’d be selling Penny. it’s cute.\n",
      "31449\n",
      " It’s stupid.\n",
      "31450\n",
      " Well, maybe people would like you more if you didn’t crap all over their ideas.\n",
      "31451\n",
      " I’m gonna go with Penny on this one. Then again, why wouldn’t I? I mean, we go way back.\n"

      " It just seems like a risky investment.\n",
      "31495\n",
      " I get that. I, okay, look, the real reason this is important is, before my dad left me and my mom, he used to take me to the comic book store. It was one of the few things we did together.\n",

      "31505\n",

      "31506\n",
      " No.\n",
      "31507\n",

      "31519\n",

      "31691\n",
      " Like behavior modification?\n",
      "31692\n",

      "31698\n",

      "31719\n",
      " Okay, okay, this is obviously very important to her. Let’s just, we’ll help her study so she can get done quicker. Here, here, I’m gonna quiz you. I’m gonna quiz you. I got your notes. I got your notes. I got your notes. If you want these, they’re gonna be at the strip club.\n",

      "32136\n",

      "32160\n",
      " They’re not dating. They’re just two friends who went out to dinner.\n",
      "32161\n",
      " And then went back to the home they share where they probably fell asleep in the matching pajamas she got them because they both just love penguins.\n",

      "32163\n",

      "32164\n",
      " Like you and your dog.\n",

      " Fine, it bothers me. You happy?\n",
      "32167\n",
      " You think you’ve got problems. The gibbon is the only member of the ape family not classified as a great ape.\n",
      "32168\n",
      " How is this helpful?\n",
      "32169\n",
      " All the non-human apes are classified as great apes except one. That means taxonomists created the entire category of lesser ape just to single out the poor gibbon as the weird kid on the playground. Now there’s a hairy little fellow with a genuine beef.\n",
      "32170\n",
      " But the gibbon doesn’t know what it’s categorized as. It doesn’t even know it’s called a gibbon.\n",
      "32171\n",
      " True. Sorry, kid, you’ve got it worse than a gibbon.\n",
      "32172\n",

      " Hey.\n",

      " What’s with the clothes?\n",
      "32179\n",
      " Well, with all the new stuff I bought for work, I needed to make room in my closet.\n",
      "32180\n",
      " I meant why are they folded? But whatever. Ooh, what’s this?\n",
      "32181\n",
      " That, believe it or not, is my prom dress.\n",
      "32182\n",
      " Wow, you still have it? I just assumed it was balled up in the corner of a barn somewhere.\n",
      "32183\n",
      " What kind of teenager did you think I was?\n",
      "32184\n",
      " Slutty.\n",
      "32185\n",
      " Easy.\n",
      "32186\n",
      " The word is popular.\n",
      "32187\n",
      " How was your prom? Did you go?\n",
      "32188\n",
      " No, but I was on clean-up crew.\n",
      "32189\n",
      " Aw, that’s sad.\n",
      "32190\n",
      " No, it was okay. The DJ let me dance one slow song with my mop before he shut down. Whenever I see a bucket of dirty water, I still hear Lady in Red.\n",
      "32191\n",
      " My prom was pretty terrible, too. I was so excited about my date, but it turned out he only asked me ’cause he liked my friend. He spent the whole night talking about her.\n",
      "32192\n",
      " Okay, we get it, you had a friend and a date. Stop bragging.\n",
      "32193\n",
      " Doesn’t matter. Prom is silly anyways.\n",
      "32194\n",
      " Easy for you to say; you probably went with the captain of the football team.\n",
      "32195\n",
      " No. I just made out with him a little while his date was puking.\n",
      "32196\n",
      " My date would’ve had to clean that up.\n",
      "32197\n",
      " Ooh, I have an idea. Maybe we can have, like, a prom do-over.\n",
      "32198\n",
      " Oh, that would be so much fun. We could decorate the roof and make the guys wear tuxedos.\n",
      "32199\n",
      " Ooh, and get our hair done, and slow-dance.\n",
      "32200\n",
      " Okay, guys, trust me, as someone who’s been to, like, seven proms, it is never as good as you want it to be.\n",

      " You went to seven proms?\n",
      "32202\n",

      "32207\n",
      " Oh, yeah, I got that Evite. Ever since I saw Pretty in Pink, I’ve wanted to go to an American prom. But then I saw Carrie, and I did not want to go to an American prom. But then I saw Never Been Kissed, and I’m back on the prom bandwagon. This prom thing’s been a real roller coaster.\n",
      "32208\n",
      " Bernie’s really excited. I could tell because her voice got so high, the beagle next door started howling.\n",
      "32209\n",
      " Did you go to your prom?\n",
      "32210\n",
      " No. I had a date with a proper education. Instead of a tuxedo, I dressed myself in good habits. Instead of spiked punch, I enjoyed the intoxicating flavour of knowledge. Instead of dancing in a gym, I shook my bootyto the seductive rhythms…\n",
      "32211\n",

      "32215\n",
      " Hmm, to be honest, it’s kind of a dream come true to go to even a fake prom with a woman as beautiful as you.\n",

      "32408\n",

      "32412\n",
      " I do. I have the drive to the hospital right here. That is if you make it to the car without falling down the stairs. And don’t expect me to carry you, I do that enough in life.\n",
      "32413\n",
      " Buddy, I, I get that you’re worried about me and I, I appreciate that, but I’m not going to die.\n",
      "32414\n",
      " You don’t know that.\n",
      "32415\n",
      " Well, I do know that it won’t be from an asteroid strike.\n",
      "32416\n",

      "32417\n",
      " If there was an asteroid strike, wouldn’t you die, too?\n",
      "32418\n",
      " I don’t know, I’m smart and scrappy, I think I’d find a way.\n",
      "32419\n",
      " Tell you what, the surgery’s not for a week, I’ll think about it.\n",
      "32420\n",
      " Thank you. And while you’re thinking about it, if you have the surgery in Nicaragua during monsoon season, I can practically guarantee your death.\n",
      "32421\n",
      " So I found this fencing school in Burbank that has a Jedi class. And if you’re cool being the only adults there, they said they are.\n",

      "32425\n",

      "32426\n",
      " No, it’s fine. It’s not that big a deal. As long as they’re happy, I’m happy. And when I get to see them for the holidays, I’ll get to celebrate Diwali twice, one at each house. That’s double the Diwali.\n",

      "32433\n",

      " Don’t worry about that. I’m happy to take you to work.\n",
      "32436\n",
      " Well, thank you. And Leonard never lets me have French toast sticks in the car. I can’t have syrupy fingers, but he can do the backstroke in a toilet bowl.\n",
      "32437\n",
      " It’s nice they’re getting exercise.\n",
      "32438\n",

      "32439\n",
      " I’m sure he brought it.\n",
      "32440\n",
      " No, but last year, at Magic Mountain, he got such a bad sunburn, we had to cut him out of it.\n",
      "32441\n",

      " You mean ’cause this room isn’t supposed to have dust in it, and we just let in a flying crap machine?\n",
      "32776\n",
      " What do we do? Should we call someone?\n",
      "32777\n",
      " And tell them that we compromised all the equipment? Let’s just get it out of here before anyone knows.\n",
      "32778\n",
      " Okay, how do we catch it?\n",
      "32779\n",
      " Well, what if we turn off all the lights except for one, and it’ll come to it.\n",
      "32780\n",
      " It’s not a moth.\n",
      "32781\n",

      " So, Dr. Koothrappali, long flight?\n",
      "32785\n",

      "32802\n",

Not only am I going to this foolish dinner against my will, at the Christmas tree lot, there was mistletoe, and she kissed me under it in public. Like we were the stars of a Tijuana sex show.\n",
      "32803\n",
      " She’s just excited about the holidays.\n",
      "32804\n",

      "32805\n",
      " How?\n",
      "32806\n",
      " Hmm. It’d have to be something heinous, something that makes her as miserable as she’s making me. Oh, I’ve got it. This is good.\n",
      "32807\n",
      " What?\n",
      "32808\n",
      " I’m going to buy her a present.\n",
      "32809\n",
      " Yeah, you’re gonna have to walk me through that.\n",
      "32810\n",
      " With gift-giving, there’s an implied social contract. If I show up tonight with a present, and she doesn’t have one for me, she’ll feel terrible.\n",
      "32811\n",
      " Then you’re both sad?\n",
      "32812\n",
      " Yes. Maybe she’ll feel so guilty, she’ll never make me celebrate the holidays again.\n",
      "32813\n",
      " So your evil plot here is to buy your girlfriend a present?\n",
      "32814\n",
      " That’s right. So stay on my good side, or I’ll get you a little something, too.\n",
      "32815\n",

      "32898\n",
      " You were right. Go ahead, call Building Services. Tell them it was my fault.\n",
      "32899\n",
      " No, we’re both to blame. You know, let me take the heat on this one.\n",
      "32900\n",
      " Yeah, just leave me out of it. You know if they come here and see crap everywhere, they’re just gonna blame the Indian guy.\n",
      "32901\n",
      " It’s kind of boring. Although it did get exciting for a minute when Amy inhaled a wool ball. How much longer do you think you’ll be?\n",

      "32919\n",

      "32920\n",
      " I thought you hate giving gifts.\n",
      "32921\n",
      " Yeah, I do. Which is why I got Amy this.\n",
      "32922\n",
      " You got me something?\n",
      "32923\n",
      " Oh, not just something, no. It’s from the heart, it’s holiday-themed, and I swallowed the gift receipt so you cannot return it.\n",
      "32924\n",
      " Look at you on Santa’s lap. That’s so sweet.\n",
      "32925\n",
      " Of course it is. It’s the perfect gift. How are you feeling right now? Guilty? Sad? Wishing you were Jewish?\n",
      "32926\n",
      " No, I love it.\n",
      "32927\n",
      " Oh, really? Well, how about now? (On recording) Happy holidays to my dear Amy. I hope you treasure this as much as I treasure you. (Not on recording) And you got me nothing. Christmas is ruined. Let’s never speak of it again. Well, this was fun.\n",
      "32928\n",
      " Actually, I did get you something.\n",
      "32929\n",
      " But what about our agreement?\n",
      "32930\n",

      " I can’t believe this. You’re happy, I’m happy. Well, maybe a holiday that’s all about giving isn’t so… Get your hand out of that box.\n",
      "32936\n",
      " Okay. The next game is called Hot Boiled Beans.\n",
      "32937\n",
      " Of course it is.\n",
      "32938\n",

      " Okay, well, if you find him, use the kitchen island, that coffee table will not support both of you.\n",

      "33369\n",

      " Are you kidding me? You lost my mother’s ashes?\n",
      "33813\n",
      " All right, fine. Where did you misroute the only woman who ever loved me? The first, well,\n",
      "33814\n",
      " Eight sixteen.\n",
      "33815\n",
      " I really did mean first.\n",
      "33816\n",
      " Just drop it.\n",
      "33817\n",
      " Um, well, it’s, uh, black. There’s a red ribbon tied to the handle.\n",
      "33818\n",
      " The world’s greatest mom is in the shoe compartment.\n",
      "33819\n",
      " You ready to begin?\n",
      "33820\n",
      " Yup. Be right there. I assume you don’t want wine.\n",
      "33821\n",
      " Correct. You’re not supposed to drink alcohol when operating heavy machinery.\n",
      "33822\n",
      " What heavy machinery? Let’s just start.\n",
      "33823\n",
      " Well, as a Texas gentleman, I’m inclined to say ladies first. Although, I’m concerned that level of politeness and charm might make you fall in love with me before the test even begins. Perhaps we should flip a coin. Or if you’re familiar with the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors…\n",
      "33824\n",
      " Question one. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?\n",
      "33825\n",
      " Hmm. Living or dead?\n",
      "33826\n",
      " Just says anyone in the world. I guess that means living.\n",
      "33827\n",
      " Ah, that’s just as well. As much as I’d love to meet Euclid, inventor of the geometric proof, he probably wore sandals and I cannot look at toes during dinner. Oh, I know, the person I’d most like to have dinner with is myself.\n",
      "33828\n",
      " You sure that’s your choice? ‘Cause I’ve had that dinner.\n",
      "33829\n",
      " Well, I haven’t. And while they say never meet your heroes, I just don’t see how I could disappoint. Who would you choose?\n",
      "33830\n",
      " Robert Downey, Jr.\n",
      "33831\n",
      " Oh, I didn’t think of Iron Man. You know, maybe after myself and I have dinner, we can meet you two for dessert.\n",
      "33832\n",
      " So, what do you guys want to do?\n",
      "33833\n",
      " Well, we’re the ones tagging along, you pick.\n",
      "33834\n",
      " What’s that?\n",
      "33835\n",
      " Oh, so kind of like what’s happening with Penny right now.\n",
      "33836\n",
      " What would constitute a perfect day for you?\n",
      "33837\n",
      " Uh, well, I’d probably sleep in, do a little yoga, then lie on the beach while cute cabana boys brought me drinks and probably get a massage and then cap off the night with some dancing.\n",
      "33838\n",
      " That’s it?\n",
      "33839\n",
      " Yeah, why?\n",
      "33840\n",
      " You didn’t mention Leonard.\n",
      "33841\n",
      " He’s there.\n",
      "33842\n",
      " I don’t think so. Leonard can’t stand yoga, the beach, massages or dancing.\n",
      "33843\n",
      " Yeah, well, he brought a book, okay? What’s yours?\n",
      "33844\n",
      " Uh, I wake up. Uh, I enjoy some French toast with butter and syrup. Uh, then a wormhole opens, and whisks me millions of years into the future where my towering intellect is used to save the last remnants of mankind from a predatory alien race.\n",
      "33845\n",
      " Interesting, you didn’t mention Amy.\n",
      "33846\n",
      " Who do you think made the French toast with butter and syrup?\n",
      "33847\n",
      " Ladies?\n",
      "33848\n",
      " Yup.\n",
      "33849\n",
      " Oh.\n",
      "33850\n",
      " This is cool.\n",
      "33851\n",
      " So, how do we start?\n",
      "33852\n",
      " Uh, wasn’t there supposed to be a zombie?\n",
      "33853\n",
      " Ooh. Okay, let’s hope one of the clues is written on a pair of clean underwear.\n",
      "33854\n",
      " So, where is it?\n",
      "33855\n",
      " So, some stranger has my mom? Is that what you’re telling me? My poor mother can be anywhere in Los Angeles right now?\n",
      "33856\n",
      " Oh, okay, great. So, your entire job is to find lost luggage, and you’ve narrowed down the location of my mother to the planet Earth.\n",
      "33857\n",
      " If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?\n",
      "33858\n",
      " Well, not to steal from the Bible, but turning water into wine sounds pretty good.\n",
      "33859\n",
      " I don’t think you’re taking this seriously.\n",
      "33860\n",
      " Come on, I’m just having some fun with you.\n",
      "33861\n",
      " I believe what you’re doing is using humour to avoid vulnerability.\n",
      "33862\n",
      " Fine. Honestly, if I could have one quality, I wish I could be as smart as you guys.\n",
      "33863\n",
      " Ha. Keep dreaming.\n",
      "33864\n",
      " Sheldon.\n",
      "33865\n",
      " Well, I can’t read people’s minds. Actually, that’s not true, I can read men’s minds, but only ’cause it’s usually the one thing.\n",
      "33866\n",
      " When are we going to get robot eyes?\n",
      "33867\n",
      " You’re all alike.\n",
      "33868\n",
      " Well, what I meant was I often misinterpret how others are feeling. Like, I can’t always tell if someone is only joking or laughing at me. You know, like, uh, if they’re mad at something I’ve done or just in a bad mood. It, it’s incredibly stressful.\n",
      "33869\n",
      " Really? You always seem so confident.\n",
      "33870\n",
      " Well, I’m not. And if I could read people’s minds, life would be so much simpler.\n",
      "33871\n",
      " Well, now I wish I had the ability to make that stuff easier for you.\n",
      "33872\n",
      " Thank you.\n",
      "33873\n",
      " Wow, I just felt this wave of affection for you.\n",
      "33874\n",
      " You sure it’s not too much Bible juice?\n",
      "33875\n",
      " And the wave is gone.\n",
      "33876\n",
      " Keep it down, we’re working here.\n",
      "33877\n",
      " Okay, we’ve got the cipher decoded.\n",
      "33878\n",
      " We used the coordinates to locate the cities.\n",
      "33879\n",
      " I’m putting the city names in the grid now. I’m sure that’ll give us the code to the safe.\n",
      "33880\n",
      " Yup. Got the code.\n",
      "33881\n",
      " Sure you don’t want to go home? When the bag’s returned, they’ll deliver it to us.\n",
      "33882\n",
      " No, I’m not leaving without her.\n",
      "33883\n",
      " All right, we’ll wait.\n",
      "33884\n",
      " I could’ve driven her.\n",
      "33885\n",
      " What?\n",
      "33886\n",
      " The day she left for Florida. She asked me to drive her to the airport. I was too busy. And I made her take a cab. I was too busy.\n",
      "33887\n",
      " There’s no way you could’ve known. Be right back. Excuse me?\n",
      "33888\n",
      " You better find my husband’s mother ’cause one way or another, w e’re walking out of this airport with a dead woman.\n",
      "33889\n",
      " Which book are we looking for?\n",
      "33890\n",
      " Uh, Origin of Species.\n",
      "33891\n",
      " Here it is. There’s a black light.\n",
      "33892\n",
      " Oh, okay. Uh, brothers and sisters I have none, but this man’s father is my father’s son. Who am I looking at? Yeah, yeah, we get it, you want brains. Calm down.\n",
      "33893\n",
      " Well, if I don’t have a brother, my father’s son is me. And if I’m this man’s father, then he’s my son. The answer’s son.\n",
      "33894\n",
      " I bet the key’s behind it.\n",
      "33895\n",
      " So, that’s the key to the door? That’s it?\n",
      "33896\n",
      " We spent two hundred dollars on six minutes of fun?\n",
      "33897\n",
      " It’s like when you bought that remote-controlled helicopter, and it just flew away.\n",
      "33898\n",
      " Well, to be fair, we do all have advanced degrees.\n",
      "33899\n",
      " If you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone?\n",
      "33900\n",
      " So, it would be today? Huh. Well, I suppose there’s something satisfying about dying on my birthday.\n",
      "33901\n",
      " Today’s your birthday?\n",
      "33902\n",
      " Yes.\n",
      "33903\n",
      " Well, that’s always been a secret. Not even Amy knows.\n",
      "33904\n",
      " Well, I don’t enjoy presents. And the thought of people jumping out and yelling surprise fills me with more dread than the words George Lucas Director’s Cut.\n",
      "33905\n",
      " So, why did you finally tell me?\n",
      "33906\n",
      " The point of the experiment is to be completely honest with each other.\n",
      "33907\n",
      " Well, thank you for sharing it with me. I won’t tell anyone.\n",
      "33908\n",
      " Thank you.\n",
      "33909\n",
      " That is so funny. I never would have pegged you for a Pisces.\n",
      "33910\n",
      " You’re making it difficult to love you right now.\n",
      "33911\n",
      " Oh, thank God. It’s okay, she’s here. Ma’s here.\n",
      "33912\n",
      " Okay, thank you so much.\n",
      "33913\n",
      " Ma? I’m sorry I didn’t take you to the airport. I just want you to know that I’ll never forgive myself for being so selfish. And I promise to keep you close for the rest of my life.\n",
      "33914\n",
      " Oh, no. That thing’s gonna end up in my bedroom.\n",
      "33915\n",
      " That’s it. We’re done with the questions.\n",
      "33916\n",
      " All that’s left to do is stare into each other’s eyes for four minutes without talking.\n",
      "33917\n",
      " Okay. Wait, hang on. Bladder check. We’re good to go.\n",
      "33918\n",
      " You ready?\n",
      "33919\n",
      " Yes.\n",
      "33920\n",
      " And begin. This is kind of creepy.\n",
      "33921\n",
      " We’re not supposed to talk during this part.\n",
      "33922\n",
      " Sorry.\n",
      "33923\n",
      " This is kind of creepy.\n",
      "33924\n",
      " Do you want to stop? I know you have trouble with eye contact.\n",
      "33925\n",
      " Well, you have a brown fleck in your right iris that looks like a Formula One race car. So I’m just concentrating on that. Plus, it’s easier around people that I’m comfortable with.\n",
      "33926\n",
      " Aw, sweetie, I’m comfortable around you, too.\n",
      "33927\n",
      " Of course you are, I’m warm and soothing. I’m like a human bowl of tomato soup.\n",

      "34013\n",

      " Why were you looking in it?\n",
      "34035\n",
      " Well, there’s a question I better have a good answer to before she gets back.\n",
      "34036\n",
      " Okay, calm down. There’s probably something jammed behind it. Just, uh, pull it out and see what’s there.\n",

      "34052\n",
      " Yeah. You get the paint, I’ll rest for 30 to 40 minutes, and then we do this.\n",

      "34158\n",

      " Well, why don’t we take it home and put it in our freezer?\n",
      "34214\n",
      " You don’t want to do that. Refreezing not only removes moisture, but it creates ice crystals in the fibres of the meat that can compromise its taste and texture. What? I saw a teachable moment. I dropped some culinary science.\n",

      "34236\n",
      " Does it have a camera in it?\n",
      "34237\n",

      "34240\n",
      " What?\n",
      "34241\n",
      " I spoke to the reporter at the magazine.\n",
      "34242\n",
      " What happened? Did you tell him it was my idea?\n",
      "34243\n",
      " I did.\n",
      "34244\n",
      " Thank you. What did he say?\n",
      "34245\n",
      " He said they made the editorial decision to only cite the lead scientist.\n",
      "34246\n",
      " Why did he think you’re the lead scientist? It was my idea.\n",
      "34247\n",
      " You know, for an extra four bucks, I can have this thing here tomorrow.\n",
      "34248\n",
      " Well, I know it was your idea, but the reporter said he’s been following my work for a while, and the only reason they even mentioned it in the magazine is ’cause my name is on it.\n",
      "34249\n",
      " You know what? I did it. What’s four bucks?\n",
      "34250\n",
      " If you’re trying to make me feel better, it’s not working.\n",
      "34251\n",
      " Well then what if I told you that I added your name to the cable bill?\n",
      "34252\n",
      " No.\n",
      "34253\n",
      " Oh. That’s just as well. They had me on hold for 20 minutes and I hung up. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? Also, Wolowitz invited us all to dinner, so I’m ready whenever you are.\n",
      "34254\n",
      " All he had was an idea.\n",
      "34255\n",
      " Well, that is an important part.\n",
      "34256\n",
      " Oh, please. I have ideas all day long. Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins are allowed to pet people. A new clothing size between medium and large called Marge. Snow White retold from the point of view of Sneezy. Why won’t Doc prescribe him something? We finally find out.\n",
      "34257\n",
      " But Leonard’s idea was good.\n",
      "34258\n",
      " Fine. Then Grumpy, what’s he so grumpy about? Maybe his girlfriend won’t take his side.\n",
      "34259\n",
      " I’m the one who thought of it.\n",
      "34260\n",
      " Well, didn’t he do a lot of the work?\n",
      "34261\n",
      " Yeah. But now he’s happy to let people think he’s responsible for everything.\n",
      "34262\n",
      " And that’s why you get an iPad helicopter.\n",
      "34263\n",
      " Is it my fault I have a much bigger reputation than he does?\n",
      "34264\n",
      " It’s not your fault.\n",
      "34265\n",
      " Is it my fault that my name came first on the paper alphabetically?\n",
      "34266\n",
      " Not your fault.\n",
      "34267\n",
      " Is it my fault that when the reporter cited me as the lead scientist I didn’t correct him?\n",
      "34268\n",
      " Hey, look at that pretty bird.\n",
      "34269\n",
      " He always needs all the attention. He’s such a baby.\n",
      "34270\n",
      " I know, I know.\n",
      "34271\n",
      " I swear, he is never ever playing with my helicopter.\n",
      "34272\n",
      " Okay, I’ll start heating some of this stuff up.\n",
      "34273\n",
      " Thanks.\n",
      "34274\n",
      " Oh, man. This is the boutonniere from my high school prom. A piece of cake from my Bar Mitzvah.\n",
      "34275\n",
      " Did she throw anything away?\n",
      "34276\n",
      " No. If I find my foreskin, I’m gonna kill myself.\n",
      "34277\n",
      " Okay, so we’ve got, um, three briskets, four meatloafs, one lasagna.\n",

      "34279\n",

      "34280\n",

      " You okay?\n",
      "34282\n",
      " Yeah, I’m okay. Let’s get started.\n",
      "34283\n",

      " Should we tell everyone not to come?\n",
      "34286\n",
      " No. I want to do this.\n",
      "34287\n",
      " Okay. Well, I’ll keep it together if you can.\n",

      "34300\n",

      "34301\n",

      " You know, Tor, the God of Tunder. As I was saying, is this a sign that our society is approaching gender equality?\n",
      "34320\n",
      " Certainly a lot more women are reading comic books now.\n",
      "34321\n",
      " We won’t know if there’s equality until female Thor has a baby and the Avengers are cool with her pumping breast milk at work.\n",
      "34322\n",
      " I wonder if only a baby who is worthy can suckle at the bosom of Thor.\n",
      "34323\n",
      " Okay, new salon topic. Salons, dumb thing from a long time ago or interesting thing made dumb by talking about superheroes? Discuss.\n",
      "34324\n",
      " I don’t believe it matters what the topic is. What’s crucial for a salon is that we conduct the discussion in an elevated and insightful way. It’s all about the execution.\n",
      "34325\n",
      " Of course you’d focus on that rather than the inspiration. Uh, new salon topic. What’s more important, an idea or its execution?\n"

      "34538\n",

      "34548\n",

      "34778\n",
      " Okay, that sounds like us.\n",
      "34779\n",

      "34786\n",
      " I bet that started off as a joke, but by the third one you realized there was something strangely enjoyable about it.\n",
      "34787\n",
      " Yeah, I kind of want to do it again.\n",
      "34788\n",

      "34800\n",

      "34801\n",
      " What’s going on in here?\n",
      "34802\n",

      "34821\n",

      "34822\n",
      " Right. I couldn’t change if I wanted to.\n",
      "34823\n",
      " You better not change, because I love who you are. Now, will you need help cleaning all this up when you’re done or can you do it all by yourself?\n",

      " Yeah, uh, I got a job as a pharmaceutical sales rep.\n",
      "34903\n",
      " Well, kind of. But now I get to act like inflamed heart is only a mild side effect.\n",
      "34904\n",
      " Yeah, it’s going okay, but I do miss this sometimes.\n",
      "34905\n",
      " Mmm.\n",
      "34906\n",
      " Yeah. I started that rumour.\n",
      "34907\n",
      " Okay, since we agree on the delivery system for the message, maybe we should talk about what the message could be.\n",
      "34908\n",
      " Well, I think we should show what earthlings look like.\n",
      "34909\n",
      " The plaque they sent up on the Pioneer probe had a drawing of a naked man and woman on it.\n",
      "34910\n",
      " Yeah, I never cared for that. It’s advertising to predator races just how soft and squishy we are.\n",
      "34911\n",
      " Squeeze yourself.\n",
      "34912\n",
      " Oh, don’t be offended. You know, of the four of us, you have the most veal-like consistency.\n",
      "34913\n",
      " Well, maybe there’s a way to appear non-aggressive, but also be able to protect ourselves if necessary. Like smiling and waving with one hand, but the other hand holding the severed head of a tiger.\n",
      "34914\n",
      " You want to send a passive-aggressive message out into the universe? That’s ridiculous.\n",
      "34915\n",
      " Oh, you mean passive-aggressive like posting pictures of you and your wife eating cosmopolitan balls that you know belong in my mouth?\n",
      "34916\n",
      " Perhaps Howard meant passive-aggressive like asking our group to help on your project, and then only choosing Leonard.\n",
      "34917\n",
      " Look, I’m sorry I hurt your feelings, but you do have strong personalities and always end up taking over.\n",

      " You know what? You’re right. I should have asked you.\n",

      "34927\n",
      " Okay, and if we’re talking about being left out of things, you guys went to Skywalker Ranch without us.\n",
      "34928\n",

      "34929\n",

      "34930\n",

      "34935\n",

      " But, Daddy, I, I miss my family so much, and with you and Mummy getting a divorce, I feel sad and empty. Buying a little toy every now and then helps me fill that void. So while I can’t hug you every day, flying that helicopter…\n",

      "35065\n",

      "35066\n",
      " Well, let’s not talk about him or whatever shenanigans he may or may not be up to. Let’s talk about you.\n",

      "35282\n",
      " Yes.\n",
      "35283\n",
      " That’s probably it. What’d you say to her?\n",
      "35284\n",
      " Well, I just asked her if I should start watching the new Flash TV series.\n",
      "35285\n",
      " And that made her angry?\n",
      "35286\n",
      " Baffling, right? We were necking like a couple of hooligans under the school bleachers. I stopped so I could ask the question. Next thing I know, good-bye, kissy face. Hello, yelly face.\n",
      "35287\n",
      " Well, Sheldon, when you’re kissing a girl, she expects the attention to be on her.\n",
      "35288\n",
      " It was. I asked her if she thought I should watch The Flash.\n",
      "35289\n",
      " Yeah. I’m tapping out. Leonard?\n",
      "35290\n",
      " I’m gonna guess that your main concern is the time commitment of watching an entire season of a new show.\n",
      "35291\n",
      " Oh, no, not just a season. If I’m in, I’m in for the whole run, even if the quality declines.\n",
      "35292\n",
      " I get it. Smallville almost wrecked you.\n",
      "35293\n",
      " Yeah. Exactly. You know, I waited ten years to see a guy everyone knows can fly, fly.\n",
      "35294\n",
      " Wait, what is wrong with you two? He was talking about television during their date night.\n",
      "35295\n",
      " Oh, not just date night, our fifth anniversary.\n",
      "35296\n",
      " Okay, see, that’s even dumber than you wondering if being bitten by a goat would give you the powers of a goat.\n",
      "35297\n",
      " If that happens, don’t make me wait ten years to watch you eat a tin can.\n",
      "35298\n",
      " You guys ever notice that Emily has a bit of a twisted side?\n",
      "35299\n",

      "35304\n",
      " What difference does it make?\n",
      "35305\n",
      " Well, if it’s her father’s grave and they didn’t get along, then you know she holds a grudge.\n",
      "35306\n",

      "35307\n",
      " Well, what if it’s one consenting adult and one adult who pretends to consent because he’s afraid of being alone?\n",
      "35308\n",
      " Well, then I guess bring a blanket. The grass gets damp at night.\n",
      "35309\n",

      " Right. You’re gonna break up with a girl who has sex with you. Can you believe this guy?\n",

      "35317\n",
      " That’s not the same thing. Emily’s a person. Stuart’s more like an infestation, something you spray for.\n",
      "35318\n",
      " Baloney, okay? You two are as afraid of hurting someone’s feelings as I am.\n",

      " Oh, my God. Yes. Why would you even ask that?\n",
      "35368\n",
      " I don’t know. Because we don’t have a date?\n",
      "35369\n",
      " Well, you want a date, pick a date.\n",
      "35370\n",
      " It’s not just the date. We haven’t talked about anything. Big wedding, small wedding, indoor, outdoor?\n",

      " Outdoor? Oh. I can RSVP no right now.\n",
      "35372\n",
      " Okay, indoor it is. Big or small?\n",
      "35373\n",
      " Is your dad paying for it?\n",
      "35374\n",
      " I doubt it.\n",
      "35375\n",
      " Okay, two friends each.\n",
      "35376\n",
      " All right, well, I want it in a church.\n",
      "35377\n",
      " Fine. I want black-tie.\n",
      "35378\n",
      " Fine. I want to release butterflies.\n",
      "35379\n",
      " Seriously? Airborne worms?\n",

      "35389\n",

      "35390\n",
      " No, it’s okay.\n",
      "35391\n",
      " Yeah, maybe it’s good you got us talking about this stuff.\n",
      "35392\n",
      " Well, look at that, even when I’m causing problems, I make the world a better place. Hey, next, why don’t we tackle your penchant for whining and Penny’s love of the ol’ glug-glug?\n",
      "35393\n",
      " Uh, Sheldon, I think we’re good for now.\n",
      "35394\n",
      " Ah, well, very well. So does this mean you’ll finally pick a wedding date?\n",
      "35395\n",
      " Here we go again. Why is everyone so concerned with us setting a date? We’re committed to each other. We’re happy. A ceremony isn’t gonna change anything.\n",
      "35396\n",
      " So you’re never getting married? It’s his whining, isn’t it?\n",
      "35397\n",

      "35398\n",

      " Ew, 50? We’ll be old and gross.\n",
      "35401\n",
      " Yeah, but we’ll be old and gross together.\n",

      "35404\n",

      "35430\n",

      "35431\n",
      " Yeah, but we could get heart-shaped pancakes.\n",
      "35432\n",
      " I’m sure we’ll find a decent chapel.\n",
      "35433\n",
      " Yeah. This is crazy.\n",
      "35434\n",
      " I know. You think people are gonna be mad?\n",
      "35435\n",
      " Maybe. But this isn’t about them, it’s about us.\n",
      "35436\n",
      " It is. It is about us.\n",
      "35437\n",
      " And you know what the best part is? We took our time. I mean, we met, we were friends for a couple years, then we got together, and then we got untogether, then we worked out all our problems, and now we know everything about each other, we can just go forward with no surprises and no regrets.\n",

      "35443\n",
      " What?\n",
      "35444\n",
      " Remember, uh, a couple years back when I was on that research ship in the North Sea?\n",
      "35445\n",
      " Yeah.\n",
      "35446\n",
      " Okay, well, there, there was a lot of drinking and craziness going on.\n",
      "35447\n",

      "35448\n",
      " Okay, um, well, there was this girl.\n",
      "35449\n",
      " What did you do?\n",
      "35450\n",
      " Nothing really. It was just kissing.\n",
      "35451\n",
      " And then what?\n",
      "35452\n",
      " And then nothing. I stopped it. But it still bothers me, and I wanted you to know.\n",
      "35453\n",
      " All right.\n",

      " Why are you telling me this now?\n",

      " Well, like I said, we’re about to get married, and I, I want a clean slate. No secrets.\n",
      "35461\n",
      " Really? Because to me, it seems like we’re about to get married and you’re trying to sabotage it.\n",
      "35462\n",
      " Would you rather I didn’t tell you?\n",
      "35463\n",
      " No, I don’t want there to be secrets between us.\n",
      "35464\n",
      " See, now I’m confused. I mean, what, what am I supposed to do?\n",
      "35465\n",
      " Uh, keep your mouth off other women.\n",
      "35466\n",

      " Yeah?\n",
      "35469\n",

      "35470\n",
      " Right.\n",
      "35471\n",
      " Just kissing.\n",
      "35472\n",

      "35475\n",
      " Yes.\n",

      " Wow.\n",
      "35608\n",
      " Right. Um, okay. Leonard, I mean, you’re not only the love of my life. I mean, you’re my best friend, and, you’ve got a friend in me. You got troubles. I got ’em, too. There isn’t anything I wouldn’t do for you. We stick together, and we can see it through, ’cause you’ve got a friend in me.\n",

      " No, we totally won.\n",
      "35614\n",
      " Amy, I don’t understand, are we broken up or not? It’s like you can’t make up your mind.\n",
      "35615\n",
      " It’s because you’re not giving me any space to think.\n",
      "35616\n",
      " Well, you should think fast, because men can sire offspring their entire lives, but those eggs you’re toting around have a sell-by date.\n",
      "35617\n",
      " You know what, Sheldon, you’ve made this really easy. You’re immature, you’re selfish, you just insulted me to my face. I don’t need any more time to think. We’re broken up.\n",

      "35636\n",
      " Oh, no. No, come on. I have a friend in you. You said so.\n",
      "35637\n",
      " You’re right. Just forget it.\n",
      "35638\n",
      " Yeah. Okay, listen. If you’re imagining that it was sexy, it wasn’t. We, we were both drunk, and she smelled like an ashtray. The boat was moving a lot, so I chipped her tooth.\n"

      "35709\n",
      " Yeah, well, and you admit it, like a man. All you hear women say is, I’ll just have a salad. You know? Where’s my lip gloss? I think this element should be called radium. That last one was Madame Curie.\n",

      " Hey.\n",
      "35718\n",

      " Please, tell me how I can fix it.\n",
      "35724\n",
      " Glad you asked. As I see it, there’s a simple solution. Your lips had a dalliance with the lips of another woman. It seems only logical that to restore balance to the relationship, you should find another man and dally with him. And by dally, I mean some hardcore mouth-on-mouth action.\n",
      "35725\n",

      "35746\n",
      " Well, if you want to see less of me, maybe we should go out again.\n",
      "35747\n",

      "35748\n",

      "35755\n",

      "35756\n",
      " You think it’s hard having one wife, try having two.\n",
      "35757\n",
      " I bet you told Bernadette all about how he was screwing around with Mandy Chao.\n",
      "35758\n",
      " Oh, we didn’t screw around. We just got drunk and made out.\n",
      "35759\n",

      "35760\n",

      "36729\n",
      " You have a will?\n",
      "36730\n",
      " Yeah. My 1/18 scale Wil Wheaton action figure. I also have the other kind of will, and in it I will my Wil back to Wil.\n",
      "36731\n",
      " Will Wil want it?\n",
      "36732\n",
      " Oh, what’s that ring box?\n",
      "36733\n",
      " Oh. That is an engagement ring that I was going to give my girlfriend Amy.\n",
      "36734\n",
      " What?\n",
      "36735\n",
      " You bought her a ring?\n",
      "36736\n",
      " No, no. This has been in my family for generations. Except for a short time when Comanches cut off my great-great-great-grandmother’s finger and stole it.\n",
      "36737\n",
      " No. The Texas Rangers tracked them down to their village and slaughtered every last one of them. It was a happy ending. Well, for my nine-fingered Nana.\n",
      "36738\n",
      " Okay, back to the ring. Does Amy even know about this?\n",
      "36739\n",
      " No. She broke up with me before I could broach the subject.\n",
      "36740\n",
      " Oh, man, I’m sorry, that must have been devastating for you.\n",
      "36741\n",
      " No, not at all. No, I’m fine. You know, Amy had reservations about our relationship, so all worked out for the best.\n",
      "36742\n",
      " I know. It just…\n",
      "36743\n",
      " Yes. Oh, for example, three years ago when I discovered Penny was eating all my Pop-Tarts, instead of getting angry or vindictive, you know, I got a floor safe.\n",
      "36744\n",
      " I knew I could smell ’em.\n",
      "36745\n",
      " Oh, certainly. Uh, when I was eight years old, Billy Sparks cornered me in the playground. I asked myself what would Spock do? Then I grabbed Billy on his shoulder and performed my first Vulcan nerve pinch.\n",
      "36746\n",
      " Oh, no, he broke my collarbone. I can still hear it click.\n",
      "36747\n",
      " Oh, not at all. As I said, the entire point of emulating Spock was to rise above human emotion, which I’ve spent a lifetime mastering.\n",
      "36748\n",
      " Oh pfft.\n",
      "36749\n",
      " Excuse me?\n",
      "36750\n",
      " I’m sorry. I’m not here.\n",
      "36751\n",
      " No. You went pfft. What does pfft mean?\n",
      "36752\n",
      " Um.\n",
      "36753\n",
      " You did go pfft.\n",
      "36754\n",
      " All right, fine. Well, Sheldon, I’m no expert, but aren’t you completely missing the point of Spock? I mean, he liked to act like he had no emotions, but he was still half human.\n",
      "36755\n",
      " Just like you.\n",
      "36756\n",
      " I’m just saying, you pretend you don’t, but you have feelings just like everybody else.\n",
      "36757\n",
      " Not true. No, look at me. I had an engagement ring to give a girl, and instead, she rejected me. And am I emotional about that? No. No, I am sitting here on a couch, talking about my favourite TV character like nothing happened. ‘Cause I am just like him, all logical, all the time.\n",
      "36758\n",
      " Sweetie, you’re yelling.\n",
      "36759\n",
      " Because when I speak at a regular volume, no one seems to believe me that I’ve put this Amy nonsense behind me.\n",
      "36760\n",
      " Yeah. Yeah, I feel like an archaeologist. Indiana Jones and the Single-Family Dwelling. Hey. Look. Found a seashell.\n",
      "36761\n",
      " Oh.\n",
      "36762\n",
      " Sorry. Do you have a sense of where we are?\n",
      "36763\n",
      " Oh. Okay, so we must be under the dining room.\n",
      "36764\n",
      " Why wouldn’t I want to hear it?\n",
      "36765\n",
      " That’s not true at all. I wish she’d get pregnant, believe me. I’m climbing on top of her every chance I get. In a loving and respectful manner. The point is, I really do want kids.\n",
      "36766\n",
      " I don’t know why she’s lying to you. She’s the one who doesn’t want kids. In fact, every time I bring up the subject…\n",
      "36767\n",
      " Oh, my God, we’re gonna die.\n",
      "36768\n",
      " Aftershock.\n",
      "36769\n",
      " I can’t believe Sheldon was gonna ask Amy to marry him.\n",
      "36770\n",
      " I know. I also can’t believe he watched what we did on that couch and still sits on it.\n",
      "36771\n",
      " Yeah.\n",
      "36772\n",
      " Hello.\n",
      "36773\n",
      " Hey, buddy. How you doing?\n",

      "36775\n",
      " Yeah.\n",

      " Oh, yeah.\n",
      "36778\n",
      " Definitely.\n",
      "36779\n",

      "36785\n",
      " What are you gonna do?\n",
      "36786\n",
      " I’m going to find her and ask her to marry me. And if she says yes, we can put this behind us and resume our relationship. And if she says no, well, then she can just ponfo miran.\n",

      " Dear Crazy Future Sheldon, this is a thermostat. It controls the temperature of the apartment. The ideal setting is 72 degrees. If you find this too cold, then put on a jacket. A straitjacket, ’cause 72’s the best and you’re crazy. Now, this is your spot. You’re very protective of it. When anyone else tries to sit here, you berate them relentlessly. It sounds mean, but somehow you make it adorable. People are also delighted by your love of pranks. For example, Leonard has no idea what I did to his coffee. It wasn’t replace it with Folger’s crystals, I’ll tell you that much.\n",
      "37296\n",
      " Hey, can we please get back to work?\n",
      "37297\n",
      " This is Leonard. He’s your best friend in the world.\n",
      "37298\n",
      " All right, just stop. This is ridiculous.\n",
      "37299\n",
      " Sometimes he gets cranky, but you can trust him with your life. And he does more things for you than I can even begin to list.\n",
      "37300\n",
      " Thank you.\n",
      "37301\n",
      " Oh, no, he’s drinking it.\n",
      "37302\n",
      " Look at this. Trent is rebuilding a vintage motorcycle.\n",
      "37303\n",
      " That is so cool. Old broken things are so much better than new things that work.\n",
      "37304\n",
      " Who’s Trent?\n",
      "37305\n",
      " Oh, he’s our fan.\n",
      "37306\n",
      " Fan of what?\n",
      "37307\n",
      " Uh, did you forget? We’re in a band.\n",
      "37308\n",
      " You mean because you played one time in the comic book store?\n",
      "37309\n",
      " And at the children’s hospital until they asked us to leave.\n",
      "37310\n",
      " Hey, dude, Trent just checked in at the coffee shop on Fair Oaks.\n",
      "37311\n",
      " Really? You want to go down there and meet him?\n",
      "37312\n",
      " Are you stalking him? That’s creepy.\n",
      "37313\n",
      " It’s not creepy. I built a Footprints on the Moon fan page, Trent joined it.\n",
      "37314\n",
      " After that, all I did was check out his profile, go back in the archive of his feed until I found his Twitter handle.\n",
      "37315\n",
      " From there, it was easy to find him on Instagram, Snapchat and pretty much track his every movement.\n",
      "37316\n",
      " So if you think that’s creepy, you married the wrong guy.\n",
      "37317\n",
      " Maybe I should marry Trent.\n",
      "37318\n",
      " Yeah, like she could get Trent.\n",
      "37319\n",
      " Thank you.\n",
      "37320\n",
      " When you were married, did your wife cook?\n",
      "37321\n",
      " So, a little silver lining.\n",
      "37322\n",
      " Uh, about five years. I’m actually thinking of moving to a better place now that I don’t need to be so close to, well, you know.\n",
      "37323\n",
      " Yeah. Anyway, he doesn’t drive, so, I pretty much had to take him everywhere.\n",
      "37324\n",
      " My fault. I brought him up.\n",
      "37325\n",
      " Bah, bam, bum-bum, bah, bum, bum. This song is never going to stop. Have you ever dealt with something so relentlessly irritating?\n",
      "37326\n",
      " That’s a trick question, right?\n",
      "37327\n",
      " Well, I shouldn’t be surprised. There’s a rich history of brilliant minds descending into madness.\n",
      "37328\n",
      " Come on, Sheldon. There are plenty of smart people who don’t have mental problems.\n",
      "37329\n",
      " Yup, she’s right. For every Newton who had a psychological issue, there’s an Edison who was just a jerk. That could totally be you.\n",
      "37330\n",
      " Empedocles thought he was a god and jumped into a volcano. And Pythagoras had an irrational fear of beans. Tesla fell madly in love with a pigeon who he claimed loved him back.\n",
      "37331\n",
      " Maybe he just had bread in his pocket.\n",
      "37332\n",
      " The list extends outside of science. Painters like Van Gogh and Pollock, chess champion Bobby Fischer, Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys. (Clip of Darling by the Beach Boys) I remember the song. It’s called Darlin’ by the Beach Boys. Oh, thank goodness. I’m not crazy. I don’t have to take a pigeon as my bride.\n",
      "37333\n",
      " There goes our shot at him living on the roof.\n",
      "37334\n",
      " So, all right, there he is. So, should we introduce ourselves?\n",
      "37335\n",
      " No. Let him spot us.\n",
      "37336\n",
      " I wonder if he’s listening to our music right now.\n",
      "37337\n",
      " Could you imagine? What a cool way for us to meet. He’s playing our song and looks up, and there we are, his favorite two-piece acoustic sci-fi novelty rock band.\n",
      "37338\n",
      " And he’s, all, like, aren’t you the guys from Footprints on the Moo-oo-ooh what is he doing?!\n",
      "37339\n",
      " I can’t watch.\n",
      "37340\n",
      " It’s okay. Oh, it’s okay. He’s done.\n",
      "37341\n",
      " Why is he looking at it?\n",
      "37342\n",
      " Eh, no, he’s not going to eat it, is he?\n",
      "37343\n",
      " Come on, Trent, you’re better than th-ah.\n",
      "37344\n",
      " Ooh!\n",
      "37345\n",
      " Let’s just go.\n",
      "37346\n",
      " Nope.\n",
      "37347\n",
      " No, never heard of ’em!\n",
      "37348\n",
      " I wonder why it was this particular song that was stuck in my head.\n",
      "37349\n",
      " I don’t know. It’s pretty catchy.\n",
      "37350\n",
      " Do you even like the Beach Boys?\n",
      "37351\n",
      " They have beach right in the name. What do you think?\n",
      "37352\n",
      " Well, now that you can focus again, what do you say we get back to surface tension of domain walls?\n",
      "37353\n",
      " Of course. I’m already seeing a more efficient way of taming the ultravi… I know why the song was in my head.\n",
      "37354\n",
      " Why?\n",
      "37355\n",
      " It’s about Amy.\n",
      "37356\n",
      " Okay, look, I know Amy’s like an old lady, but she’s not old enough to have a song from the sixties written about her.\n",
      "37357\n",
      " It’s about how she made my life better. Consider the lyrics. I was living like half a man. Then I couldn’t love, but now I can. More soul than I ever had. I love the way you soften my life.”\n",
      "37358\n",
      " She did soften your life, didn’t she?\n",
      "37359\n",
      " Yes. She’s like the dryer sheets of my heart. I have to go.\n",
      "37360\n",
      " Aw. Am I like the dryer sheets of your heart?\n",
      "37361\n",
      " Better. You’re the lint trap of my love.\n",
      "37362\n",
      " Aw.\n",
      "37363\n",
      " That’s an interesting tie clip.\n",
      "37364\n",
      " No, I, I think it’s neat. Oh.\n",
      "37365\n",
      " No, it, it’s okay, and we are on a date. I’m, I’m just a little nervous.\n",
      "37366\n",
      " You know, I’m just being silly. I, I don’t know what I’m waiting for.\n",
      "37367\n",
      " (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy?\n",
      "37368\n",
      " That’s Sheldon.\n",
      "37369\n",
      " Sheldon, this, this isn’t a good time.\n",
      "37370\n",
      " I don’t care. Amy, there was a song I couldn’t get out of my head. Eventually, I realized the song was about you, and like that earworm, I can’t get you out of my heart. So, what I’m trying to say is, you’re my heartworm. The metaphorical kind, not, not the poodle-killing kind.\n",
      "37371\n",
      " What?\n",
      "37372\n",
      " I’m, I’m sorry; I didn’t realize you were on a date.\n",

      "37391\n",
      " All right, this goes against everything I stand for, but desperate times call for desperate measures. Lord, this is Sheldon Cooper. You’re good friends with my mom. I know I’ve spent my life denying that you exist.\n",
      "37392\n",
      " Got ’em.\n",

      "37521\n",

      " What?\n",

      "37633\n",
      " Hmm. What are you doing now?\n",
      "37634\n",

      "37635\n",
      " Oh, I see. How about now?\n",
      "37636\n",
      " Now I’m making sure the telescope’s camera is white-field balanced and wishing you had a colouring book.\n",
      "37637\n",
      " Well, I can be helpful. Give me something to do. You know, my father took me to work once, and in ten minutes I figured out who’d been stealing from the cash register. It was my father. Yeah, Dad lost his job, but Mr. Hinckley gave me a Fudgsicle.\n",
      "37638\n",
      " Fine, you want something to do? There’s about six months of data on this hard drive. Why don’t you go through it and see if you can spot any patterns or anomalies.\n",
      "37639\n",
      " Yep, I’m on it. Hey, look at that, an Indian guy outsourcing a computer job to a white fella.\n",
      "37640\n",
      " Yeah, okay, whatever it takes to keep you busy for a few hours.\n",
      "37641\n",
      " Found one.\n",
      "37642\n",
      " No, you didn’t. There are millions of data points there.\n",
      "37643\n",
      " But, look, an optical transient.\n",
      "37644\n",
      " Yeah, maybe that is something. How did you find that?\n",
      "37645\n",
      " It wasn’t difficult. You know how when you see prime numbers, they appear red, but when they’re twin primes, they’re pink and smell like gasoline?\n",
      "37646\n",
      " No.\n",
      "37647\n",
      " Oh. I guess I’m a special boy. You know, sometimes when a boy is special, he gets a Fudgsicle. Which, by the way, tastes like the speed of light.\n",
      "37648\n",
      " Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.\n",
      "37649\n",
      " Uh, she’s my mother. You know her?\n",
      "37650\n",
      " Well, then you know her better than I do.\n",
      "37651\n",
      " Really? Any chance you find them cold, cruel and unsuitable for innocent little boys who just want to be happy?\n",
      "37652\n",
      " No, no, say it. Sing it. Rent a plane, write it in the sky.\n",
      "37653\n",
      " Oh, no, I, I’ve worked through a lot of that stuff, I’m better now.\n",
      "37654\n",
      " Do you know she never let me celebrate my birthday because being born was her achievement, not mine?\n",
      "37655\n",
      " Right? To this day, I send her a card every year with a little money in it.\n",
      "37656\n",
      " You know, once we get the house back to ourselves, we can be romantic in any room we want.\n",
      "37657\n",
      " Great. I can finally show you where the laundry room is.\n",
      "37658\n",
      " No one.\n",
      "37659\n",
      " Nobody thought that.\n",
      "37660\n",
      " I guess so.\n",
      "37661\n",
      " Yeah. A grown man moving into his own apartment. Crazy times. See ya.\n",
      "37662\n",
      " Ignore him. He’s just using humour to express how happy he is.\n",
      "37663\n",
      " Sure he does. Well, let us know when you’re all settled in.\n",
      "37664\n",
      " Our pleasure.\n",
      "37665\n",
      " Goodbye.\n",
      "37666\n",
      " He’s gone. Let’s start in the garage.\n",
      "37667\n",
      " Okay, so once we receive the next image and compare it to the ones we’ve already collected, we’ll know what it is that we found.\n",
      "37668\n",
      " Ooh, perhaps it’s a Heliosheath scintillation.\n",
      "37669\n",
      " It could be a trans-Neptunian object.\n",
      "37670\n",
      " Maybe it’s a new planet.\n",
      "37671\n",
      " Unlikely, but it could be a dwarf planet.\n",
      "37672\n",
      " Well, as long as it has a healthy gravity and all its moons, I’ll be happy.\n",
      "37673\n",
      " Okay, the final image is coming in. And the object we discovered is…\n",
      "37674\n",
      " Come on, Daddy needs a livable planet he can rule with an iron fist.\n",
      "37675\n",
      " A medium-sized asteroid.\n",
      "37676\n",
      " That’s it? How common. That’s the chicken fingers on the menu of space.\n",
      "37677\n",

      "37678\n",
      " Yeah, me, too. I was stuck for a metaphor.\n",
      "37679\n",
      " Come on, a medium-sized asteroid is still an interesting discovery.\n",
      "37680\n",

      " Okay, now, what I’m hearing is that you feel that I sometimes take too long to express myself, and you wish I’d be more succinct.\n",
      "37690\n",
      " You’re only hearing that because I cannot roll my eyes any louder.\n",
      "37691\n",
      " All right, well, after we talked about my issues with my mother, nothing too deep, just how she ruined my life, I told her about you and your drug. She said she’d be happy to meet you.\n",
      "37692\n",
      " Really? Oh, you’re the best husband ever.\n",
      "37693\n",
      " So you’ll go to the Doctor Who convention with me next week?\n",
      "37694\n",
      " I guess.\n",
      "37695\n",
      " Oh, I actually did hear your eyes roll that time.\n",
      "37696\n",
      " Boy, when was the last time Stuart cleaned this place?\n",
      "37697\n",
      " No kidding. Oh, okay, I’m about to suck something up. What do you think this object sounds like?\n",
      "37698\n",
      " Howie, I don’t want to play Lego, Toenail or Pill anymore. So, what do you think we should do with this room?\n",
      "37699\n",
      " Well, I was thinking a home theatre or a gaming room, you know, like a man cave.\n",
      "37700\n",
      " Why can’t it be a woman cave?\n",
      "37701\n",
      " As long as it has a home theatre, a video game system and you’re not allowed in it, you can call it whatever you want.\n",
      "37702\n",
      " I’m being serious.\n",
      "37703\n",
      " Well, what do you think we should do?\n",
      "37704\n",
      " I don’t know, maybe a home office or, oh look. The teddy bear Stuart won the night we took him to the fair.\n",
      "37705\n",
      " Oh. He was so excited.\n",
      "37706\n",
      " Yeah. You know, no matter how hard they tried, they could not guess his age.\n",
      "37707\n",
      " I’ll give it to him next time I see him.\n",
      "37708\n",
      " Have you heard from him since he left?\n",
      "37709\n",
      " No. You’d think he would’ve called once he got settled in.\n",
      "37710\n",
      " Hmm. Maybe he’s busy.\n",
      "37711\n",
      " Too busy to call? He wasn’t too busy to binge-watch Hot in Cleveland with my Hulu password. What is happening? Are we missing him?\n",
      "37712\n",
      " No, that’s not what this feeling is. Is it?\n",
      "37713\n",
      " Of course not. He drove us crazy. Like when you were gonna make that pie and Stuart ate all the blueberries.\n",
      "37714\n",
      " And he tried to deny it, but his teeth were all purple.\n",
      "37715\n",
      " That was pretty cute.\n",
      "37716\n",
      " Yeah. Ew, we are missing him!\n",
      "37717\n",
      " So I was thinking, maybe we can come up with a name for the asteroid by combining our names.\n",
      "37718\n",
      " That’s a great idea. I’ve got it. We’ll call it Cooper.\n",
      "37719\n",
      " How is that both our names?\n",
      "37720\n",
      " Koo from Koothrappali and per from Cooper.\n",
      "37721\n",
      " Yeah, s-so it’s, like, Kooper with a K?\n",
      "37722\n",
      " Nah, you’re right, that’s dumb.\n",
      "37723\n",
      " Hey.\n",
      "37724\n",
      " Oh, Leonard, great news. We discovered a medium-sized asteroid together.\n",
      "37725\n",
      " Wow, that’s amazing. I’m in a pretty great mood today myself.\n",
      "37726\n",
      " Okay. Guess we’re gonna talk about you now.\n",
      "37727\n",
      " Well, we are, because Dr. Gallo made me realize that I’m a worthwhile person and that my feelings matter.\n",
      "37728\n",
      " I learned that for free from a cat poster, but good for you.\n",
      "37729\n",
      " Okay, back to me. I discovered an asteroid, and now I get to name it.\n",
      "37730\n",
      " Wait, what happened to us?\n",
      "37731\n",
      " Now, this isn’t about us, this is about what’s best for the asteroid.\n",
      "37732\n",
      " Well, what are you thinking of naming it?\n",
      "37733\n",
      " I haven’t settled on anything yet.\n",
      "37734\n",
      " We haven’t settled on anything yet.\n",
      "37735\n",
      " All right, way to go, Cat Poster. You hang in there.\n",
      "37736\n",
      " You know what’d be nice? Name it after your girlfriends. Show them how much you care.\n",
      "37737\n",
      " That is a great idea.\n",
      "37738\n",
      " It’s perfect. It appears romantic, but it’s really just a rock in space that gets me out of Valentine’s Day forever.\n",
      "37739\n",
      " So, uh, what were you thinking? Combine their names?\n",
      "37740\n",
      " I like it. Yeah, we’ll take the A-M from Amy and, uh, the Y from Emily.\n",
      "37741\n",
      " That’s just Amy.\n",
      "37742\n",
      " Exactly. See how well we work together?\n",
      "37743\n",
      " And in double-blind studies, Placinex proved extremely effective in treating all kinds of anxiety. Actually, funny story, the boys in the lab were worried about getting FDA approval for Placinex. They started taking it, stopped worrying.\n",
      "37744\n",
      " Uh, do you have any questions?\n",
      "37745\n",
      " Mm-hmm?\n",
      "37746\n",
      " I just meant a question about the drug.\n",
      "37747\n",
      " I don’t wanna.\n",
      "37748\n",
      " You know, I used to wear tank tops a lot. That was a big selling point.\n",
      "37749\n",
      " Good news. You’re an asteroid.\n",
      "37750\n",
      " Uh, please tell me what to say next.\n",
      "37751\n",
      " Perhaps I should explain. While working with Koothrappali, we discovered an asteroid, and I named it after you.\n",
      "37752\n",
      " Oh. Sheldon, thank you. That’s so romantic. But what about Rajesh? He was okay with you choosing the name?\n",
      "37753\n",
      " Well, it took a little negotiating, but I wore him down. Uh, we get the asteroid, and if you and I have children, they all have to be named Rajesh.\n",
      "37754\n",
      " All of them?\n",
      "37755\n",
      " Even the girls.\n",
      "37756\n",
      " Okay, I think I know what to say now.\n",
      "37757\n",
      " How can I not sound like his mother when our entire bedroom is filled with Star Wars toys? I mean, have you ever had sex with a stuffed Wookiee watching you?\n",
      "37758\n",
      " You know, if anything, he’s turning me into his mother. Before I did pharmaceutical sales, I was an actress. You know, I was pretty good. You know, girl-next-door type, but hot. Doable.\n",
      "37759\n",
      " And not only am I Leonard’s mother, but we have this man-child living with us named Sheldon.\n",
      "37760\n",
      " Yeah, he’s as real as the fine I get when I use too much toilet paper.\n",
      "37761\n",
      " I do. You know, Leonard’s right. Talking to you is really helping.\n",
      "37762\n",
      " Okay, if you think it’ll help. Oh, just don’t make it Placinex. I do not need sudden fits of homicidal rage.\n",
      "37763\n",
      " I miss you as well.\n",
      "37764\n",
      " I can’t believe I miss Stuart.\n",
      "37765\n",
      " I guess I just miss when life was simpler.\n",
      "37766\n",
      " Remember, girls, you decide what makes you happy, not your emotionally withholding mothers.\n",
      "37767\n",
      " Hey, so I saw a movie trailer the other day. How could Batman possibly fight Superman? I mean, isn’t that dumb?\n",
      "37768\n",
      " Maybe he uses Kryptonite.\n",
      "37769\n",
      " No, no, no, no, no. I’ve seen that movie. It’s called Iron Man.\n",
      "37770\n",
      " What is happening?\n",
      "37771\n",
      " I don’t know.\n",
      "37772\n",
      " But it’s beautiful.\n",
      "37773\n",
      " And now Ben Affleck is Batman?\n",
      "37774\n",
      " Ooh, we should watch that next girls’ night.\n",
      "37775\n",
      " We could do a double feature with the Leonardo Di Caprio Romeo and Juliet.\n",
      "37776\n",
      " Oh, I love me some Leo.\n",
      "37777\n",
      " And it’s gone.\n",
      "37778\n",
      " Oh, hello, everyone. I am happy to report I’m feeling much better.\n",
      "37779\n",
      " Good for you.\n",
      "37780\n",
      " My fever is gone, my sinuses are pressure-free, and my mucus is as clear as a Yosemite waterfall.\n",
      "37781\n",
      " Glad to hear it.\n",
      "37782\n",
      " I’ll be able to return to work tomorrow.\n",
      "37783\n",
      " Yay.\n",
      "37784\n",
      " Well, why isn’t everyone happy? Your little ray of sunshine is ready to beam again.\n",
      "37785\n",
      " You really don’t know why?\n",
      "37786\n",
      " No. But I knew that his yay was sarcastic. Not bad for a guy whose last bowel movement sounded like rain on a roof.\n",
      "37787\n",
      " Let me refresh your memory.\n",
      "37788\n",
      " Penny, rub Vicks on my chest.\n",
      "37789\n",
      " Sheldon, I cooked you breakfast. I made your bed. I checked your mouth for thrush. You can rub your own chest.\n",
      "37790\n",
      " Oh, sure, grope every other male on the planet, but draw the line with me.\n",
      "37791\n",
      " I brought you a little care package from work. It’s our latest antiviral and the best decongestant we make.\n",
      "37792\n",
      " I hope laughter is the best medicine, ’cause this care package is a joke.\n",
      "37793\n",
      " Hey, she came all the way here…\n",
      "37794\n",
      " You’re gonna want to take these with food.\n",
      "37795\n",
      " Sheldon, stop being a baby and let Emily take a look at you.\n",
      "37796\n",
      " She’s a dermatologist.\n",
      "37797\n",
      " Well, in that case, try removing the irritating patch of brown skin standing next to you.\n",
      "37798\n",
      " All right, here you go.\n",
      "37799\n",
      " Leonard, I’m dying.\n",
      "37800\n",
      " You’re not dying. It’s just the flu.\n",
      "37801\n",
      " I asked for chicken noodle. This is chicken and stars. It’s killing me.\n",
      "37802\n",
      " I never did get that chicken noodle, did I?\n",
      "37803\n",
      " Hello.\n",
      "37804\n",
      " Are you feeling any better?\n",
      "37805\n",
      " Physically, yes, but I’m upset because everyone’s mad at me for no good reason.\n",
      "37806\n",
      " Why don’t you tell me what happened, and in a gentle, loving way, I’ll explain to you why you’re wrong.\n",
      "37807\n",
      " You know how, when you’re sick, you’re allowed to be cranky and say whatever you want and other people’s feelings don’t matter?\n",
      "37808\n",
      " Ooh. Gentle and loving, this is gonna be tricky.\n",
      "37809\n",
      " I had a hundred and one fever. If that’s not a time to verbally abuse my loved ones, when is?\n",
      "37810\n",
      " Sheldon, when you’re sick, you can be unbearable. That’s why your friends have been known to work late or sneak out to the movies or stay at a neurobiology conference three days after it’s ended.\n"

      " You’re still not coming.\n",

      " Not you. I own your ass. The real question is, where are you with Emily?\n",
      "38079\n",
      " Uh, it’s hard to say. I think we’re good, but things like this make me wonder if Emily’s really the right person for me. I mean, did you guys ever have doubts about each other?\n",

      " No. Never.\n",
      "38081\n",

      " Okay, so far we’ve heard, made up my mind I’m dumping Emily.\n",

      "38101\n",

      "38105\n",

      " Wait, are you saying that we didn’t have a vibe?\n",
      "38108\n",

      "38109\n",
      " I knew it. Okay, we did have a vibe. This is exciting. What’s my next move?\n",
      "38110\n",
      " You still have a girlfriend.\n",
      "38111\n",
      " Right. Good catch. Anyway, so I’m sorry to waste your time. And, uh, and good luck with your screenplay.\n",
      "38112\n",
      " Not me. Ever since you admitted we had a vibe, I’ve been planning our wedding.\n",
      "38113\n",
      " Okay. That hurts a little, but okay.\n",
      "38114\n",
      " Bye. All right. So, uh, we’re meeting for coffee like two adults. Everybody’s happy. Easy peasy.\n",
      "38115\n",

      "38116\n",

      "38121\n",
      " Really?\n",
      "38122\n",
      " Well, if you understand, then why are you giving me such a hard time?\n",

      " Oh, Sheldon, thank you.\n",
      "38130\n",
      " Oh, great, now you’re gonna get emotional. I always looked up to you and Pop-Pop. I, I know what a challenging man he could be, but I saw you stand by him and-and make him into a better person.\n",
      "38131\n",
      " Yeah, well, that is exactly what I’ve been doing the last five years with this little work in progress.\n",
      "38132\n",
      " He never disappoints, does he?\n",
      "38133\n",
      " I think what Sheldon means to say is we’ve both grown together. Isn’t that right?\n",
      "38134\n",
      " Well…\n",
      "38135\n",

      "38140\n",
      " Yeah, see, if you just change the story to the destruction of our galaxy, then a super massive black hole could work.\n",
      "38141\n",

      " Yeah, just get it over with.\n",
      "38158\n",

      "38163\n",
      " Yeah, I think so. Do you have any advice?\n",
      "38164\n",
      " Well, I have broken up with my fair share of guys. I mean, how many times did I break up with Leonard?\n",
      "38165\n",
      " I stopped counting at four.\n",
      "38166\n",
      " All right, my advice to you is do it at her place so you can leave when you need to, uh, tell the truth, make it quick and be prepared for tears.\n",
      "38167\n",
      " Oh, I’m gonna do a pre-cry before I go in there. Really dry myself out.\n",

      " Well, if you made a guidance system, couldn’t you use those vortices as a gyroscope?\n",
      "38454\n",
      " Wow. I’ve never thought about that.\n",
      "38455\n",

      "38466\n",
      " Well, we didn’t exactly decide. We were talking about it, and then one night we got a little reckless.\n",

      "38468\n",

      "38473\n",

      "38474\n",
      " Well, Sheldon was going on and on about time zones and railroad schedules, and I went out…\n",
      "38475\n",

      "38489\n",
      " Can you focus on what we’re talking about?\n",
      "38490\n",
      " All right. Look, now, this may be the rum talking, but as long as the unpinning rate of the vortices is kept within 1.1 and 1.3, the Magnus force issue should be negligible.\n",

      " I’m telling you, you got this.\n",
      "38498\n",
      " Maybe you’re right.\n",
      "38499\n",

      "38545\n",
      " What is it?\n",

      " Well, your birthday’s coming up, and you’ve never let us celebrate it, and I was hoping maybe this year we could.\n",
      "38547\n",
      " Oh, I suppose that’s a discussion we could have.\n",
      "38548\n",
      " Okay, great, I mean, it doesn’t have to be a big party or anything. I was just, where’d he go?\n",

      "38550\n",

      "38562\n",
      " Can you please just tell me why?\n",
      "38563\n",
      " Fine. As you know, I have a twin sister with whom I obviously share a birthday. Every year we’d have a party. No one I invited would ever come, because they didn’t like me.\n",

      " I’m sorry.\n",
      "38565\n",
      " Oh, that part wasn’t so bad. I didn’t like them, either. But then I’d inevitably spend the whole day being tortured by my sister’s friends.\n",
      "38566\n",
      " Oh, poor thing.\n",
      "38567\n",
      " When I was six, they told me Batman was coming to my party. I waited by the door for hours. Closest thing to Batman I saw was when a robin flew into the window.\n",
      "38568\n",
      " You realize none of those things would happen now?\n",
      "38569\n",
      " I do, but why do you care if I celebrate my birthday at all?\n",
      "38570\n",
      " Well, you made my last birthday so memorable, I wanted to return the favour.\n",
      "38571\n",
      " You know, if you had a party now, you have plenty of friends that would love to come.\n",

      "39039\n",
      " I’m sorry. What, what am I looking at?\n",
      "39040\n",
      " It’s basically everything I’ve ever owned. Um, every book, every tee shirt, every piece of broken electronics. Just all of it.\n",
      "39041\n",
      " All of it?\n",
      "39042\n",
      " I have a Ziploc bag filled with all my old Ziploc bags.\n",
      "39043\n",
      " Okay. Well, I would like to tell you that there is nothing here to be ashamed of. So I’m gonna need a minute.\n",
      "39044\n",
      " All right, how are we gonna play this when they return?\n",
      "39045\n",

      "39046\n",
      " Sweetie, I know you think jokes like that are funny, but do you really think you could handle making out with both of us?\n",
      "39047\n",
      " No, ma’am.\n",
      "39048\n",
      " Okay. Okay, how about this? They don’t know you’re here with us, so you hide in the closet. When they show up, we’ll hear whatever their dumb story is about where they were, we’ll pretend to believe them and just when they think they got away with it, you jump out.\n",
      "39049\n",
      " Yeah, that’s pretty good.\n",
      "39050\n",
      " I love it, I’ll be all like, busted, and they’ll be like, what? And then we’ll all be like, oh yeah. Yeah, I get it. I wouldn’t make out with me, either.\n",
      "39051\n",
      " In here is every clock radio I’ve ever owned. Calculators, VHS tapes. Yeah. Oh. Sporting equipment.\n",

      " You have sporting equipment?\n",
      "39053\n",
      " Well, oh, it’s just a, it’s a, a golf ball that my brother threw at my head. You can still feel the dent. It’s right next to the hockey puck dent.\n",
      "39054\n",
      " Okay, why do you have a bin of pine cones?\n",
      "39055\n",
      " I used to collect them as a child. The spiral of scales open in the Fibonacci sequence. A fact that, when you tell your brother, gets a golf ball thrown at your head.\n",
      "39056\n",
      " So, why do you feel you need to save these things?\n",
      "39057\n",
      " I’d like to say it’s nostalgia, but every time I think of throwing anything away, my ears start to ring, and I get butterflies in my stomach. And then it feels like the butterflies get eaten by rats, and then the, the rats get eaten by…\n",
      "39058\n",
      " Okay. I get it. I get it.\n",
      "39059\n",

      " Really? ‘Cause every time I come in here, I think less of me.\n",
      "39062\n",
      " Why?\n",
      "39063\n",
      " Because I’m a fraud. No. I purport to be a man of the mind. I’ve been such a, a vocal champion of the singularity, but how can I leave my body behind and become one with the internet when I’ve never even thrown a toothbrush away?\n",
      "39064\n",
      " It’s okay, Sheldon. You know, I’ve saved a lot of weird things, too.\n",
      "39065\n",
      " Like what?\n",
      "39066\n",
      " Well, um, did you know I have a microscope slide with a little bit of tissue from the first brain I ever dissected?\n",

      " Please, Bernadette. Let me leave with my dignity.\n",
      "39244\n",
      " Hey, you guys want to play a drinking game?\n",
      "39245\n",
      " Oh, well now, we’ll never win. You always play the drinking game.\n",
      "39246\n",
      " Not the drinking game, a drinking game.\n",
      "39247\n",
      " To be fair, good at both.\n",
      "39248\n",
      " What’s the game?\n",
      "39249\n",
      " All right, it’s called Never Have I Ever. The rules are simple. Someone says something they’ve never done, but if you have done it, you take a drink.\n",
      "39250\n",
      " I’ve never played that before.\n",
      "39251\n",
      " Hey, now, wait. Have we started? Do I drink? What is happening?\n",
      "39252\n",
      " Okay. Calm down. I’ll go first. All right, let’s see. Never have I ever…\n",
      "39253\n",
      " She’s trying to think of something she’s never done before. This could take a while.\n",
      "39254\n",
      " Very funny. Okay, never have I ever… yeah, you know what? Let’s just circle back.\n",
      "39255\n",
      " Okay, I’ll go. Never have I ever been arrested.\n",
      "39256\n",
      " So I drink.\n",
      "39257\n",
      " No, it’s only if you’ve done it.\n",
      "39258\n",
      " Got it.\n",
      "39259\n",
      " I can’t believe you’ve been arrested.\n",
      "39260\n",
      " I can’t believe Penny hasn’t.\n",
      "39261\n",
      " Sheldon, what did you do?\n",
      "39262\n",
      " Well, I’m not proud of it, but I jaywalked.\n",
      "39263\n",
      " Oh, no, it’s like a horror movie. We’re trapped in a cabin with a maniac.\n",
      "39264\n",
      " I’m surprised you would do that.\n",
      "39265\n",
      " No, I crossed in the middle of the street. And normally, I wouldn’t, but I saw an aggressive-looking Girl Scout, and it was the heart of cookie season. Anyway, there was a police officer, and he witnessed the whole thing.\n",
      "39266\n",
      " What, he arrested you for that?\n",
      "39267\n",
      " No, he didn’t do anything. So I said, you just saw me jaywalk, why aren’t you doing your job? You know? May, maybe I should arrest you for, for impersonating a police officer.\n",
      "39268\n",
      " And then you got arrested.\n",
      "39269\n",
      " Oh, and how.\n",
      "39270\n",
      " I feel like I just made a horrible mistake.\n",
      "39271\n",
      " Yeah.\n",
      "39272\n",
      " But on the other hand, I didn’t kick him out of our lives. I just asked him to back off a little.\n",
      "39273\n",
      " Yeah.\n",
      "39274\n",
      " What? Are you gonna cry?\n",
      "39275\n",
      " Yeah.\n",
      "39276\n",
      " Is it baby hormones or actually sad?\n",
      "39277\n",
      " I can’t tell anymore.\n",
      "39278\n",
      " I’ll go get him.\n",
      "39279\n",
      " And bring back the bear.\n",
      "39280\n",
      " This game’s dangerous. I could get you in trouble.\n",
      "39281\n",
      " How?\n",
      "39282\n",
      " Well, never have I ever used Sheldon’s toothbrush to clean the sink.\n",
      "39283\n",
      " Fine, is that how you want to play this? All right, never have I ever come up with a nickname for my own genitals.\n",
      "39284\n",
      " Never should’ve told you about Alvin and the Chipmunks.\n",
      "39285\n",
      " Okay. My turn. Um, never have I ever completely rocked my girlfriend’s world in bed.\n",
      "39286\n",
      " Amy.\n",
      "39287\n",
      " You know the rules. Drink.\n",
      "39288\n",
      " Yeah, go ahead.\n",
      "39289\n",
      " That’s right.\n",
      "39290\n",
      " All right, my turn. Mm. Oh, I know. Never have I ever kept a secret bank account, because I think my wife can’t handle money. Did I win? I feel like I won.\n",
      "39291\n",
      " I can’t believe this. You realize I make more money than you?\n",
      "39292\n",
      " I don’t, I know, but this isn’t a big deal. It’s just a little savings I put aside.\n",
      "39293\n",
      " We’re married. We’re supposed to share everything.\n",
      "39294\n",
      " What, you mean, like, your massive credit card debt?\n",
      "39295\n",
      " I’m calling it. I won.\n",
      "39296\n",
      " I appreciate the apology, but it’s really not necessary. I overstepped my bounds.\n",
      "39297\n",
      " No, Raj, you’ve been great. I just, I need to start doing my part around here.\n",
      "39298\n",
      " I hear that.\n",
      "39299\n",
      " Well, if that’s the case, is there anything I can do to help?\n",
      "39300\n",
      " Well, not right now. But we could try out that microphone you got us, and listen to the baby’s heartbeat.\n",
      "39301\n",
      " Really? It’s okay if I listen with you?\n",
      "39302\n",
      " Of course.\n",
      "39303\n",
      " Can I squirt the ultrasound jelly on your stomach?\n",
      "39304\n",
      " Hey, look at that. It’s weird again.\n",
      "39305\n",
      " Okay, you have every right to be mad. And what you said is true. You do make more money than me. So I had no right to do what I did. And I’m so sorry. I hope you can forgive me.\n",
      "39306\n",
      " How long have you had this secret account?\n",
      "39307\n",
      " A couple years, but I just put a few bucks aside every month for emergencies.\n",
      "39308\n",
      " Well, how much you got in there?\n",
      "39309\n",
      " Six thousand four hundred and twenty seven dollars. Forty seven dollars once my nana’s birthday check gets here.\n",
      "39310\n",
      " My God, Leonard, do you know what I could do with that kind of money?\n",
      "39311\n",
      " No, I do, and that’s why I hid it.\n",
      "39312\n",
      " What good is it if you don’t use it?\n",
      "39313\n",
      " Uh, you have shoes you love, but never wear. I have money I love, but never spend. We’re kind of a cute couple that way. Again, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have kept it a secret.\n",
      "39314\n",
      " Well, I have a secret I’ve been keeping from you, too.\n",
      "39315\n",
      " Is it a secret bank account? Because that would be awesome.\n",
      "39316\n",
      " I hate my job.\n",
      "39317\n",
      " Really? Why?\n",
      "39318\n",
      " Because I don’t feel good flirting with doctors for sales. I mean, I know I make a lot of money. But I haven’t been happy for a while.\n",
      "39319\n",
      " Why didn’t you tell me?\n",
      "39320\n",
      " Because I know how important it is to you that I’m having some success.\n",
      "39321\n",
      " That’s not true.\n",
      "39322\n",
      " Okay, really? So you’d be fine if I went back to acting and waiting tables again?\n",
      "39323\n",
      " If that’s what you want to do, yes.\n",
      "39324\n",
      " Well, it’s not what I want to do.\n",
      "39325\n",
      " Oh, yes.\n",
      "39326\n",
      " Doesn’t matter what I want. Look, this job is gonna get me out of debt. So I’m gonna do the grown-up thing and see it through.\n",
      "39327\n",
      " Well, that is the grown-up thing.\n",
      "39328\n",
      " I guess.\n",
      "39329\n",
      " I love you.\n",
      "39330\n",
      " I love you, too.\n",
      "39331\n",
      " You know, never have I ever made love in the forest while it was raining.\n",
      "39332\n",
      " Well, guess I gotta drink.\n",
      "39333\n",
      " All right, here we go.\n",
      "39334\n",
      " I’m not hearing anything.\n",
      "39335\n",
      " Well, give me a second.\n",
      "39336\n",
      " Are you sure you can do this?\n",
      "39337\n",
      " Hey, who found four dollars and change on the beach with his metal detector?\n",
      "39338\n",
      " I buried it there, so we could go home.\n",
      "39339\n",
      " Wait, that’s it.\n",
      "39340\n",
      " Wow.\n",
      "39341\n",
      " Isn’t that the best?\n",
      "39342\n",
      " You guys made a person.\n",
      "39343\n",
      " We did.\n",
      "39344\n",
      " And I like to think I helped.\n",
      "39345\n",
      " You didn’t.\n",
      "39346\n",
      " Oh, never have I ever drunk milk past its expiration date.\n",
      "39347\n",
      " Never have I ever cancelled a dentist appointment.\n",
      "39348\n",
      " Oh, uh, never have I ever put my foot in the ocean.\n",
      "39349\n",
      " Never have I ever honked if I liked anything.\n",
      "39350\n",
      " Oh, uh, never have I ever thrown, caught or touched a Frisbee.\n",
      "39351\n",
      " Never have I ever put salt on my food without trying it first.\n",
      "39352\n",
      " Oh. Never have I ever pushed all the buttons in an elevator.\n",
      "39353\n",
      " Well, we all have a past.\n",
      "39354\n",
      " I have a question about Batman. Batman is a man who dresses up like a bat. Man-bat is a part man, part bat hybrid. Now, if Man-Bat dressed up as a man to fight crime, would he be Man-Batman?\n",
      "39355\n",
      " No, he’d be Bat-Man-Bat.\n",
      "39356\n",
      " But wouldn’t Man-Batman just be a Batman that was bitten by a radioactive man?\n",
      "39357\n",
      " But Batman is a man. You’re talking about a man who would have the powers of a man. That’s just Man-Man.\n",
      "39358\n",
      " Well, isn’t Man-Man just Man?\n",
      "39359\n",
      " But what if Man-Man dressed as a bat?\n",
      "39360\n",
      " Well, that’s just Batman.\n",
      "39361\n",
      " No, if a man dresses as a bat, that’s Batman, but if Man-Man dresses as a bat, that’s Batman-Man.\n",
      "39362\n",
      " So does that answer your question?\n",
      "39363\n",
      " Oh, I haven’t asked it yet.\n",
      "39364\n",
      " I thought you were back with Emily.\n",
      "39365\n",
      " Uh, actually I’m seeing both of them.\n",
      "39366\n",
      " You mean like through their window from behind a bush?\n",
      "39367\n",
      " No, I’m actually dating two women. Later.\n",
      "39368\n",
      " Really? The guy who for years couldn’t even talk to women is suddenly going out with two of them? How is that possible?\n",
      "39369\n",
      " I know. Scientists have tried to reproduce it with computational models, but, in each case, the world blows up.\n",
      "39370\n",
      " Seriously, that guy’s dating two women?\n",
      "39371\n",
      " What, why did you get a party sub?\n",
      "39372\n",
      " People are coming over, it looked fun.\n",
      "39373\n",
      " Well, we’re only watching Game of Thrones. A party sub implies it’s a party.\n",
      "39374\n",
      " Your attendance implies it’s not.\n",
      "39375\n",
      " I like a party as much as the next man, as long as the next man doesn’t like a party. Oh, by the way, don’t forget, tomorrow is our quarterly roommate agreement meeting.\n",
      "39376\n",
      " Oh, Sheldon, we don’t need a meeting every three months.\n",
      "39377\n",

      " There you go again.\n",
      "39441\n",
      " I’m sorry, have I been complaining about it too much?\n",
      "39442\n",
      " Actually, what you’re doing is pretending to complain, but really trying to brag.\n",
      "39443\n",
      " How could you say that?\n",
      "39444\n",
      " Oh, I wish could enjoy a cup of tea without a naked girl bouncing up and down on me.\n",
      "39445\n",
      " I never said that.\n",
      "39446\n",
      " Don’t you hate it when you can’t remember whose bra it is you found wedged in your couch?\n",
      "39447\n",
      " Okay, that I said. But that’s a real problem. You give a girl another woman’s bra, and you will not be having sex with her that night. Maybe the other girl, but not her.\n",
      "39448\n",
      " What’s going on with him?\n",
      "39449\n",
      " Oh, he’s all bent out of shape about having a roommate agreement meeting.\n",
      "39450\n",
      " Apparently, perfect attendance isn’t cool any more.\n",
      "39451\n",
      " Don’t worry, he’ll come around.\n",
      "39452\n",
      " Well, I get why he’s annoyed.\n",
      "39453\n",
      " Well, then you don’t understand what’s happening. See, Leonard refused to participate in a mandatory quarterly roommate agreement meeting. This is what a generation raised on Bart Simpson looks like.\n",
      "39454\n",
      " You love The Simpsons.\n",
      "39455\n",
      " I love Lisa Simpson.\n",
      "39456\n",
      " Well, I know how he feels. I never enjoyed our relationship agreement meetings.\n",
      "39457\n",
      " Wait. You were pretending?\n",
      "39458\n",
      " Sorry.\n",

      " No. I don’t believe you. I could tell.\n",
      "39460\n",
      " Oh, Sheldon, I never thought re-filing a matter in a standing subcommittee could be so fascinating.\n",
      "39461\n",
      " Hmm, what do you think?\n",
      "39462\n",
      " You don’t know?\n",
      "39463\n",
      " Hey, did I say something to upset you?\n",
      "39464\n",
      " No, I’m fine.\n",
      "39465\n",
      " Really? Because usually we walk side by side, and I just went up two flights of stairs staring at your bottom.\n",
      "39466\n",
      " Just drop it.\n",
      "39467\n",
      " Okay, I think I see what’s happening here. You’re jealous of me.\n",
      "39468\n",
      " Oh, please. What could you possibly have that I would be jealous of?\n",
      "39469\n",
      " It’s not what I have, it’s how many people I’m having it with.\n",
      "39470\n",
      " Come on, Sheldon, we’ll watch Game of Thrones over here.\n",
      "39471\n",
      " Gladly.\n",
      "39472\n",
      " Oh, good, go. You know, it’ll be nice to watch an episode without someone saying, I read the books, don’t get too fond of this character.\n",
      "39473\n",
      " It’s not always because they die. In one case, it’s because they’ve become involved with underground tree people from the dawn of time. Yeah, but I won’t say who it is. It’s Brann.\n",
      "39474\n",
      " Wait, what is going on?\n",
      "39475\n",
      " Leonard’s being a jerk, so we’re gonna watch over here.\n",
      "39476\n",
      " Do you guys want to watch with us?\n",
      "39477\n",
      " As long as I don’t have to watch with him.\n",

      " Fine, I don’t want to watch with you either. I’ll go over here.\n",
      "39479\n",
      " Why do you get to pick?\n",
      "39480\n",
      " Okay, then you go there.\n",

      " Tell me about it. I’ve had it with Raj, too.\n",
      "39490\n",

Step one, an admission of wrongdoing. Amy, I was wrong. Step two, a promise never to repeat said action. Amy, that action will never be repeated, and that’s a promise. Step three, an earnest request for forgiveness. Amy, I hope you can forgive me. And I hope you do it right now, ’cause there’s an Uber waiting downstairs, and I don’t want to repeat this apology nonsense with my driver Ganesh.\n",

      "40007\n",

      " Come on, Howard, you’re overreacting.\n",
      "40045\n",
      " Am I? Am I? What, what do you want to bet some black ops guy is reprinting my high school yearbook and I’m no longer in it? That chess club picture is now just David Zimmerman and Elaine Cho.\n",
      "40046\n",
      " Okay, look, I’m on the Air Force Web site, and the department that e-mailed you is in charge of acquisitions. So maybe they just want to give you a lot of money for your invention.\n",
      "40047\n",
      " Oh, please, that’s not how it works. You saw E.T., Avatar, Jurassic World. The military just shows up and takes over.\n",

      "40075\n",
      " You can’t ignore it. It’s not that postcard that says it’s time to go back to the dentist.\n",

      "40077\n",

      "40078\n",

      "40079\n",
      " Are you done with this nonsense?\n",
      "40080\n",
      " It’s not nonsense. This is how the U.S. military works.\n",
      "40081\n",
      " Oh, if it’s even the U.S. Military. It could be foreign military pretending to be American.\n",
      "40082\n",
      " You’re right. We turn our guidance system over to them, next thing we know, they’re using it against us.\n",

      "40102\n",
      " I don’t know. He uses that traffic app. Maybe there’s an accident.\n",
      "40103\n",

      " Oh, no.\n",

      "40108\n",

      "40111\n",

      "40114\n",
      " Do you realize what’s happening here?\n",
      "40115\n",

      "40121\n",

      " I’m telling you, I’m not on drugs. The government’s out to get me.\n",
      "40125\n",
      " That’s funny, because my father was not a very clever man.\n",
      "40126\n",
      " I’d be lost without you.\n",
      "40127\n",
      " Uh, I would like to propose a toast to my wife and bride-to-be.\n",
      "40128\n",

      "40129\n",
      " Back to your phone.\n",
      "40130\n",
      " Penny, I’ve always known I loved you, but this last year has shown me that I also love being married to you. Thank you for saying yes.\n",

      "40140\n",

      "40159\n",
      " Okay, I’m gonna go pick up my family. Like an hour and half, two hours, depending on traffic.\n",

      " This is ridiculous. I’m going across the hall.\n",
      "40227\n",
      " But why should you get to go and leave me here with your bickering parents?\n",
      "40228\n",
      " Fine, then you go.\n",
      "40229\n",
      " That still leaves me here with him.\n",
      "40230\n",
      " Hang on, hang on. We’re smart, we can figure this out. Okay, so: Mary and Beverley can’t be together. Uh, Alfred and Beverley can’t be together. Leonard and I can’t be together. Now, I could be with Alfred but I don’t like his face. Oh, here. I’ve got it.\n",
      "40231\n",
      " Who’s ready for a wedding?\n",
      "40232\n",
      " Great, now I have to start all over.\n",
      "40233\n",
      " Pretty good. I actually just got assigned a much better territory.\n",
      "40234\n",

      "40235\n",
      " Aw.\n",

      " Oh, you, too. Hey, everyone, this is my mother, Beverley.\n",
      "40239\n",
      " Are you excited to see your son walk down the aisle?\n",
      "40240\n",
      " You made God sad today, Mom.\n",
      "40241\n",
      " Sheldon, they haven’t done anything wrong. I think it’s nice they’re hitting it off.\n",
      "40242\n",
      " Well, that’s still no reason to rush into anything. I mean, look at us. We took things remarkably slow. You and I, we didn’t even hold hands for two years.\n",
      "40243\n",
      " It was a lot hotter than it sounds.\n",
      "40244\n",
      " Hey, hey. She’s mine, take a cold shower, grandpa.\n",
      "40245\n",
      " Why wouldn’t that colonel say what the meeting’s about? It has to be bad news.\n",
      "40246\n",
      " Calm down, okay? Try not to think about it.\n",
      "40247\n",
      " That’s really stupid advice.\n",
      "40248\n",
      " You know that hurts my feelings.\n",
      "40249\n",
      " Calm down, try not to think about it.\n",
      "40250\n",
      " Okay. \n",
      "40251\n",
      " Why do I bother talking to you?\n",
      "40252\n",
      " Oh, come on. What’s the worst that could come of this meeting?\n",
      "40253\n",
      " I don’t know. They take the invention away, and I get nothing?\n",
      "40254\n",
      " Okay, that’s not so bad. You know what happened to the scientists that worked on the Manhattan Project? The government forced them to move to the desert. They had to live in secret, and when Oppenheimer objected to what they made him do, they destroyed his reputation.\n",
      "40255\n",
      " What’s the point of that story?\n",
      "40256\n",
      " I just read a book about Oppenheimer, seemed like a chance to show off. (Howard laughs) There he is, there’s my happy Hebraic homeboy. Yeah, that’s the smile I’m gonna remember when you’re living in the desert and I’m living with your wife.\n",
      "40257\n",
      " And he can’t wait to meet you, too. Can I get anyone a drink?\n",
      "40258\n",
      " Hey. Is everyone getting to know each other?\n",
      "40259\n",
      " Okay, I think we’re ready.\n",

      " We’re here today to celebrate love.\n",
      "40262\n",
      " Not just Leonard and Penny’s love, but the love we have for them, as well as each other.\n",
      "40263\n",
      " Speaking of love, STDs among the elderly are skyrocketing.\n",
      "40264\n",
      " Love is patient, but it’s not gonna put up with all the side chatter, so let’s knock it off.\n",
      "40265\n",
      " At least she’s yelling at someone else for a change.\n",
      "40266\n",
      " Howard.\n",
      "40267\n",
      " Okay, I understand everyone’s a little tense today, so I am just gonna get to the important stuff. Leonard, standing here with you in front of our family and friends is bringing up a lot of feelings. Like what a good idea it was to elope the first time. But also how incredibly happy you make me. Thank you for marrying me. Hopefully for the last time.\n",
      "40268\n",
      " Penny, as a scientist, my job is to figure out why things happen. But I don’t think I’ll ever understand how someone like me could get to be with someone like you. You know, maybe I don’t\n",
      "40269\n",
      " Oh.\n",
      "40270\n",
      " Anybody have anything snarky to say about that? Didn’t think so.\n",
      "40271\n",
      " Thank you. All right, let’s continue.\n",
      "40272\n",
      " Yeah, excuse me, I need to say something to someone pretty special, and I just can’t wait any longer.\n",
      "40273\n",
      " It’s happening.\n",
      "40274\n",
      " Leonard, you and I have our ups and downs. But I have always considered you my family. Even before the recent threat of our parents fornicating like wrinkly old rabbits. I don’t always show it, but you are of great importance to me. Both of you. \n",
      "40275\n",
      " Oh.\n",
      "40276\n",
      " Thank you.\n",

      "40279\n",

      "40280\n",

      "40385\n",
      " I’m furious.\n",
      "40386\n",
      " Sure, sure. Uh, did you ever figure out who told?\n",
      "40387\n",
      " No. I confronted Barbara Chen, but she claimed she didn’t know what I was talking about.\n",
      "40388\n",
      " Hmm. Well, I guess it’s just gonna remain a mystery, you know, like whatever happened in that seminar after they dimmed the lights.\n",
      "40389\n",
      " It had to be Barbara. I’ve been trying to figure out a way to get back at her. Do you think using her work computer to Google how to be a prostitute is over the line?\n",
      "40390\n",
      " Uh, you know, when I was in high school, there was this girl who was talking about me behind my back, so me and all my friends, we cornered her in the bathroom and forgave her.\n",
      "40391\n",
      " What kind of revenge is that? This woman screwed with my job. She’s got to pay.\n",
      "40392\n",
      " Okay, all right, honey, you know what? There was something I was too scared to tell you yesterday, and now I’m just balls-out terrified to tell you, but the truth is it wasn’t Barbara Chen, it was me. I’m the reason everyone knows.\n",
      "40393\n",
      " Why did you do that?\n",
      "40394\n",

      "40395\n",
      " Get out.\n",
      "40396\n",
      " Oh, you know, I also lied about the girl in the bathroom. Yeah, we actually dumped her retainer in the toilet and put it back in her mouth.\n",
      "40397\n",
      " I don’t understand why I can’t talk at this meeting.\n",
      "40398\n",

      "40400\n",

      "40534\n",
      " Well, to be honest, it’s not like a party party, it’s more like a gathering where scientists of different disciplines get together to share their work and keep current on what’s going on in other fields. I don’t know why I called it a party, sorry.\n",

      "41067\n",
      " Nobody does. I was embarrassed so I didn’t say anything.\n",
      "41068\n",

      "41077\n",
      " It’s just so much easier to give him what he wants.\n",
      "41078\n",

      "41079\n",
      " Me.\n",
      "41080\n",
      " And who got him to put things other than gloves in the glove compartment?\n",
      "41081\n",
      " Me. It was mittens.\n",
      "41082\n",
      " And who got him to try a turkey dog?\n",

      " That was actually Koothrappali, but I did let him spit it out in my hand.\n",

      "41086\n",
      " Of course you do.\n",
      "41087\n",
      " And if he doesn’t like it, he can move back here.\n",
      "41088\n",
      " Oh. He can try. He’d just need a good locksmith.\n",
      "41089\n",
      " Well, who you gonna hit on? The girl in front of us got strawberry. That’s your favourite.\n",
      "41090\n",
      " No. No, if we both like it, I’ll spend the rest of my life opening the freezer and going, aw, no strawberry.\n",

      " What about the girl behind the counter?\n",
      "41092\n",

      "41637\n",
      " Look at that, put them in a tiny Flash T-shirt and it’s you.\n",
      "41638\n",

      "41647\n",

      "41648\n",
      " Mine has a fully developed immune system.\n",
      "41649\n",
      " Ours doesn’t need an immune system because it lives in a state-of-the-art German incubator.\n",
      "41650\n",
      " Sheldon, that’s enough.\n",
      "41651\n",
      " Okay, fine. Let’s just agree that both creations are special in their own way and it is foolish to try and compare them. Although, we didn’t need to have sex with Howard for ours, so we win.\n",

      " You know what I mean. You were still hot, but more like a why’d that hot girl cut off all her hair, hot.\n",

      " I was hoping by admitting my weakness to you, I’d somehow be unburdened.\n",

      " You know what? This isn’t gonna work.\n",
      "41899\n",

      "41900\n",
      " I can’t believe you punched Bert.\n",
      "41901\n",
      " I didn’t punch him. He turned around, and I gave him a Captain Kirk karate chop. I’m not even sure he knows I did it.\n",

      " How do you deal with the success of your colleagues?\n",
      "41907\n",

      "41908\n",
      " How can you feel bad if Stephen Hawking says you’re brilliant?\n",
      "41909\n",
      " I can’t. Thank you, Professor Hawking. You are a gift to mankind. There should be statues of you everywhere. You know, the Lincoln Memorial has a big chair. We could swap you right in.\n",

      "41915\n",
      " Oh, actually, I would.\n",
      "41916\n",
      " Great, what’d you have in mind?\n",
      "41917\n",
      " Let’s take every single thing from the other apartment and put it in here.\n",
      "41918\n",
      " Well, how about we start a little smaller? Like moving the furniture around.\n",
      "41919\n",
      " You know, I have always thought that this couch would look fantastic on the curb in front of the building.\n",
      "41920\n",

      " Remember that when the new TV falls off the wall and crushes us both.\n",
      "42791\n",
      " This thing’s pretty cool. It interprets emotions using a wireless signal to analyse subtle changes in breathing and heart rate.\n",
      "42792\n",
      " It’s amazing a machine can do that.\n",
      "42793\n",
      " Yes. Now, when the robots rise up, they’ll know that I’ve been rooting for them the whole time.\n",
      "42794\n",
      " The display is synced to your phone. Give it a try.\n",
      "42795\n",
      " All right. Now, I’m gonna look at some pictures to prompt an emotional response, and we’ll see if the machine can identify them accurately.\n",
      "42796\n",
      " Okay, remember, it can only detect happy, sad, angry and excited. Not other things you’re feeling, like, what have I done with my life?\n",
      "42797\n",
      " Okay, I’m looking at the first picture.\n",
      "42798\n",

      "42799\n",
      " Yes. I’m looking at puppi\n",

      " Aw. Somebody’s ignoring their tiny needle teeth, but all right. \n",
      "42801\n",
      " Try another one.\n",
      "42802\n",
      " Okay. What does it say I’m feeling?\n",
      "42803\n",
      " Sad.\n",
      "42804\n",
      " Yes. I’m looking at a picture of my grandma.\n",
      "42805\n",
      " Oh, that makes sense, ’cause she’s gone and you miss her.\n",
      "42806\n",
      " Yes.\n",
      "42807\n",
      " And you’re worried that turkey neck is in your future. What, now, see, now it says you’re mad. Make up your mind.\n",
      "42808\n",
      " Is that Emily your ex-girlfriend?\n",
      "42809\n",
      " Yeah. I’m getting all my exes together in order to discuss why they broke up with me and how I can be a better boyfriend.\n",

      " Hey, would you take a look at my brother’s résumé? I’m trying to help him clean it up a little.\n",
      "42819\n",
      " Yeah, sure. He really worked with the Drug Enforcement Agency?\n",
      "42820\n",
      " He didn’t know it till he was cuffed, but yeah.\n",
      "42821\n",
      " Hey, Leonard, if you’re happy and you know it, no need to clap your hands, because I have an emotion detector.\n",
      "42822\n",
      " How’s it working out?\n",
      "42823\n",
      " Surprisingly well.\n",
      "42824\n",
      " That’s great, I’m happy for you.\n",

      " No, wait, uh, hold on. Oh, what, you are. Aren’t you sweet?\n",
      "42826\n",
      " What’s that? Are you working on your resume?\n",
      "42827\n",
      " No, it’s my brother’s. I’m trying to help him get a job out here.\n",
      "42828\n",
      " Oh, ooh! And that makes Leonard angry.\n",
      "42829\n",
      " No, it doesn’t.\n",
      "42830\n",
      " What, Leonard, please. I know an angry face when I see it. It’s this red frowny guy on my phone.\n",
      "42831\n",
      " What? Are you really upset about Randall coming?\n",
      "42832\n",
      " No.\n",
      "42833\n",
      " Yes.\n",

      "42836\n",
      " Leonard, if you’re mad about this, just tell me.\n",
      "42837\n",
      " Fine. You invited your drug dealer brother to stay with us for God knows how long and didn’t bother to ask me first.\n",
      "42838\n",
      " He’s my brother. I didn’t think I needed your permission.\n",
      "42839\n",
      " Well, hey. Now she’s angry, too. This thing works like gangbusters.\n",
      "42840\n",
      " I’m not saying you have to ask my permission, but you could have talked to me about it before you said it was okay.\n",
      "42841\n",
      " Like you talked to me about your gaming room?\n",
      "42842\n",
      " Our gaming room. I was gonna put a scented candle in it.\n",
      "42843\n",
      " He’s still mad.\n",
      "42844\n",
      " Stop enjoying their fight.\n",
      "42845\n",
      " You first.\n",
      "42846\n",
      " If you were this upset, why didn’t you say so when I told you?\n",
      "42847\n",
      " Because I didn’t want to sound like a jerk.\n",
      "42848\n",
      " Well, you sound like one now. I don’t see the big deal if my brother comes and stays for a while.\n",
      "42849\n",
      " If you get him a job, he’s gonna live here forever!\n",
      "42850\n",
      " He would get his own place.\n",
      "42851\n",
      " Has he ever had his own place?\n",
      "42852\n",
      " Yes.\n",
      "42853\n",
      " Did it have a metal toilet next to the bed?\n",
      "42854\n",
      " It still counts. You know, how is this any different from you making me live with Sheldon?\n",
      "42855\n",
      " Hey, I shared my Honey Nut Cheerios with you.\n",
      "42856\n",
      " You gave me a bill at the end of every month. \n",
      "42857\n",
      " Stay out of this. You and your stupid machine started this fight.\n",
      "42858\n",
      " You are lucky that this feelings machine doesn’t have feelings.\n",
      "42859\n",
      " Come on, Sheldon, let’s go.\n",
      "42860\n",
      " Gladly. Can we storm out?\n",
      "42861\n",
      " I think it loses its impact if we’re chatting about it.\n",
      "42862\n",
      " Fine. I’ll just give them the finger.\n",
      "42863\n",
      " Okay, first off, I want to thank you all so much for coming. Howard is here to interpret for Emily, and to take notes. \n",
      "42864\n",
      " No, he doesn’t think it’s stupid.\n",
      "42865\n",
      " Uh, heads up, both of you are named Emily, so we’ll call you red-headed Emily, and you, red-headed Emily, Junior.\n",
      "42866\n",
      " Hey, you went out with him. I didn’t.\n",
      "42867\n",
      " Okay, uh, let’s get things started. Um, why don’t we go around the room, say your name, and why you broke up with me. Want to kick it off?\n",
      "42868\n",
      " Like this one?\n",
      "42869\n",
      " I did do that. I can be insensitive to other people’s boundaries. Howard, would you write that down?\n",
      "42870\n",
      " Schmuck. Got it.\n",
      "42871\n",
      " Uh, next?\n",
      "42872\n",
      " Okay, new rule, everybody only gets one. Uh, next?\n",
      "42873\n",
      " Oh. He’s here to support me, so anything you have to say you can say in front of him.\n",
      "42874\n",
      " Howard, get out.\n",
      "42875\n",
      " Not a chance. So, you were telling us how Raj was terrible in bed.\n",
      "42876\n",
      " Sheldon, dinner’s ready. I made beef loaf, because I know you’re uncomfortable with the non-specificity of meat loaf. Sheldon? Hey, are you okay?\n",
      "42877\n",
      " Not really.\n",
      "42878\n",
      " What’s going on?\n",
      "42879\n",
      " I wish I never tried that device. And I know I said the same thing after the massage chair, but this time I mean it.\n",
      "42880\n",
      " I’m sorry Leonard and Penny hurt your feelings.\n",
      "42881\n",
      " It’s more than that. It’s me. I always knew I had trouble recognizing other people’s emotions, but that machine just made it so real.\n",
      "42882\n",
      " Well, everybody has things that they need help with. Like me, I can’t see without my glasses. And right now you’re just a, a cute, pink smudge wearing a childish green smudge.\n"

      " Good for you, on the cutting edge of new technology and still making inappropriate comments about the mother of your child.\n",
      "42957\n",
      " Those are just the things I say out loud.\n",
      "42958\n",
      " Gentlemen, we need to stop immediately.\n",
      "42959\n",
      " What’s wrong?\n",
      "42960\n",
      " I’m looking at the math, and I think we can make the device between eight and ten percent smaller.\n",
      "42961\n",
      " That’s great, but the Air Force approved the specs. We’re good to go.\n",
      "42962\n",
      " Yeah. It doesn’t need to be smaller. \n",
      "42963\n",
      " Shame on you. Where would we be if poodle breeders had that attitude? I’ll tell you. We would have the standard and the miniature poodle, but no toy or teacup. Which by the way, is not an officially recognized breed, but that’s just poodle politics.\n",
      "42964\n",
      " Can we please stop talking about poodles?\n",
      "42965\n",
      " Fine. Candy bars. Now, do you enjoy a fun size? I know you do.\n",
      "42966\n",

      "42978\n",

      " When does that start?\n",
      "43986\n",

      "44255\n",
      " I’d say she’s copying you again, but I’m getting tired of sitting in the hall.\n",
      "44256\n",
      " I’d love a personal trainer. I haven’t seen my abs since they opened a Shake Shack on my drive home.\n",

      "44261\n",
      " I’m sorry, Bert, but aren’t you worried she’s only with you for your money?\n",
      "44262\n",
      " Your first date? Did you even measure her walls?\n",
      "44263\n",
      " You know, on our first date, Leonard used a coupon to buy me a pretzel.\n",
      "44264\n",

      "44272\n",

      " Oh, so our love is not real?\n",
      "44350\n",

      "44376\n",
      " The theory is that if you really tax your brain, the neurofibers will become thicker and the glial cells more lustrous.\n",
      "44377\n",
      " Like J-Lo’s hair.\n",
      "44378\n",
      " Boy, it is neck and neck right now.\n",
      "44379\n",
      " How is super-aging any different than, like, doing crossword puzzles?\n",
      "44380\n",
      " Well, it’s not just doing simple cognitive tasks. You need to push your brain out of its comfort zone and reach mental exhaustion.\n",

      "44389\n",
      " What? He loves you, okay? And he’s interested in your work. You could talk about the infinite perspective… I swear I know it.\n",
      "44390\n",
      " It’ll be fine, let’s just go.\n",
      "44391\n",

      "44402\n",
      " Is this part of your super-aging?\n",
      "44403\n",
      " Yes. Yeah, it seemed daunting at first, but then I realized, it’s like the chemistry set I had as a kid. Only, when your brother eats this, no one has to call Poison Control.\n",
      "44404\n",
      " Okay. Shall we? Oh, my God. It’s light, it’s flaky, it’s buttery. You don’t need to have sex with him, just eat one of these.\n",
      "44405\n",
      " Yes, it is delicious. Physicist, baker, lover, what can’t I do?\n",
      "44406\n",

      "44411\n",
      " I have Sheldon, that keeps most people away.\n",

      "44414\n",
      " She’s doing amazing. She can actually make a side effect, like 10% chance of liver failure, sound like a 90% chance of liver success.\n",
      "44415\n",
      " Yeah, lying isn’t my favourite part of the job. Actually, I’m not crazy about a lot of it.\n",

      " Yes, I’m juggling my love for you and my embarrassment of you right now.\n",
      "44425\n",
      " And it’s hard, isn’t it? So the key is, the moment one ball is at the top of its arc, you toss the next one. Hmm?\n",
      "44426\n",
      " Okay, I think I got that.\n",
      "44427\n",
      " Uh, hold on. There’s an old saying in juggling.\n",
      "44428\n",
      " Is it I’m going to die alone?\n",
      "44429\n",
      " No, it’s if you want to have fun, start with one. Yours we think, but we do not say. All right, just toss it up and catch it a few times, get comfortable with it.\n",
      "44430\n",
      " Okay. Just to be on the safe side, am I in any danger of getting juggler’s elbow?\n",

      "44434\n",

      "44435\n",
      " Well, maybe, I mean, it seems kind of perfect. I have sales experience, and I’ve been a waitress, so I have restaurant experience, and if he’s figuring out my Christmas bonus, we could buy a boat.\n",

      "44528\n",
      " Not if I want to be doing this later.\n",
      "44529\n",
      " Hey, I didn’t know you were home. Where you been?\n",

      " Why?\n",
      "44534\n",
      " Well, since you find my magic tricks so embarrassing, I got to wondering what cool hobbies you had as a kid.\n",
      "44535\n",
      " Oh. What’d she say?\n",
      "44536\n",
      " She didn’t say much of anything. But she said a lot. (Through ventriloquist’s doll) Hi, Bernadette, remember me?\n",

      " First of all, that’s not what she sounds like, she’s from South Carolina.\n",
      "44538\n",
      " I can’t believe you made fun of me all these years while you were a closeted ventriloquist.\n",
      "44539\n",
      " Okay, it’s not like I wanted to be a ventriloquist. I was in beauty pageants and I needed a talent besides spreading rumours that the other contestants were pregnant.\n",
      "44540\n",
      " Well, since you enjoyed getting rid of all my stuff, you know, maybe we should throw this little lady in the wood chipper.\n",
      "44541\n",
      " No. And the little lady has a name.\n",
      "44542\n",
      " Which is?\n",
      "44543\n",
      " Tammy Jo St. Cloud.\n",

      " Tammy Jo St. Cloud. Oh, and I’m a dork for juggling.\n",
      "44545\n",
      " Sorry, you’re not a dork. (Through doll) You’re a clown. (Bernadette) Tammy Jo, don’t say that, you’ll make him feel bad. (Doll) Look at him, what reason he got to feel good?\n",
      "44546\n",
      " All right, very funny.\n",
      "44547\n",
      " Don’t listen to her, she’s been in a box for, like, 25 years. (Doll) Yeah, back when his haircut was fashionable.\n",
      "44548\n",
      " That’s enough, put her away.\n",
      "44549\n",

      " You know, what you need to do is put this Air Force project behind you and just dive into something new.\n",
      "44647\n",

      "44648\n",
      " Oh, I don’t know, I mean, let’s say we succeed in proving that our consciousness creates reality. I mean, what will we have really accomplished? You know, a loaf of bread’s still three bucks.\n",

      " That is true, I have said that.\n",
      "44651\n",

      "44652\n",
      " I was offered a summer research fellowship at Princeton.\n",
      "44653\n",

      "44660\n",
      " Are, are you sure?\n",
      "44661\n",
      " Yes. I may have lost my guidance system and my girlfriend, but I still have a colon full of yesterday’s meals to keep me company. Although, thanks to your high fibre breakfast, I’m sure that’ll be leaving me, too.\n",
      "44662\n",

      "44670\n",
      " Well, distance might be nice. The last time a big project ended for Howie, he wouldn’t stop following me around. He even went with me to get a mammogram.\n",
      "44671\n",
      " Well, what’s wrong with that?\n",
      "44672\n",

      "44674\n",

      "44675\n",
      " Of course. I get to be part of the first team to use radon markers to map the structures that…\n",

      "44678\n",
      " I know, but what if Sheldon…\n",
      "44679\n",
      " Okay, listen to me. Your relationship can handle being long distance for a while. It’s not like you two are very physical.\n",
      "44680\n",
      " Hey, you don’t know what goes on behind closed doors.\n",
      "44681\n",
      " A lot of lectures?\n",
      "44682\n",
      " All right, so you know.\n",

      "44693\n",
      " You could try saying that without smiling.\n",

      "44730\n",
      " Well, I’m not looking forward to it, but it is a wonderful opportunity and you need to take it. Besides, Princeton is in New Jersey, so it’s not like you’re gonna want to stay. Uh, I know it’s not your birthday, but if you’re interested…\n",
      "44731\n",
      " I am.\n",

      " Is it?\n",
      "44752\n",
      " Hmm, yes. Yeah, perhaps I’ve been harder on them than they deserve.\n",

      " Do you think it’s possible you might enjoy being on your own for a little while?\n",
      "44754\n",

      "44809\n",
      " Wait, isn’t she the grad student that used to follow him around?\n",
      "44810\n",
      " Oh, yeah. Back before he hit puberty and grew man parts.\n",
      "44811\n",
      " So what do you guys think that’s about?\n",
      "44812\n",
      " Knowing Sheldon, nothing.\n",
      "44813\n",
      " So, tell me about your scalar dark energy experiment.\n",
      "44814\n",
      " Oh. You must be one of those dessert before dinner people.\n",
      "44815\n",
      " He just made her laugh, something’s wrong.\n",
      "44816\n",
      " Do you see the way she’s looking at him?\n",
      "44817\n",
      " Yeah. Like Bernadette used to look at me.\n",
      "44818\n",
      " I keep telling you, close the bathroom door.\n",
      "44819\n",
      " Ah, did you see that? She just touched his hand and he didn’t swat it away. What is happening?\n",
      "44820\n",
      " Okay, the simplest explanation is usually the right one.\n",
      "44821\n",
      " Which is?\n",
      "44822\n",
      " That ain’t Sheldon.\n",

      "44826\n",
      " No.\n",

      " Ugh. How can you think that? Why would you even put those words together?\n",
      "44833\n",

      "44834\n",
      " Nowitzki. I googled her, she’s pretty cute.\n",
      "44835\n",
      " Really? All I got from Leonard was the Toblerone bar had nuts.\n",
      "44836\n",
      " And get this, I saw an articulating ladder with dual-leg leveling, which delivers stability and adaptability to uneven terrain.\n",
      "44837\n",
      " Sounds like a big night.\n",
      "44838\n",
      " Yeah. Raj made the funniest joke, he said, which is the best ladder to use to hang myself?\n",
      "44839\n",
      " So you’re keeping busy? You’re not lonely?\n",
      "44840\n",
      " Oh, not at all. I’ve had outings with Leonard and Raj in the evening, and, oh, I had lunch\n",
      "44841\n",
      " Who’s he?\n",
      "44842\n",

      "44843\n",
      " Oh. Really? Uh, when did you meet her?\n",
      "44844\n",
      " Many years ago. Back when she was a grad student. She’s always been a huge fan of my work, and now she’s doing research at Caltech.\n",
      "44845\n",
      " Huge fan, you say?\n",
      "44846\n",
      " Yes. I think you’d like her. She’s extremely intelligent, just like you. Unlike you, she’s tall, blonde and used to be an Olympic swimmer.\n",
      "44847\n",
      " That’s terrific. I’ll call you right back.\n",
      "44848\n",
      " I gave you one job. Keep an eye on him. How hard is that?\n",
      "44849\n",
      " We thought you meant not letting him run out into traffic.\n",
      "44850\n",
      " Which he only did once.\n",
      "44851\n",
      " Why didn’t you tell me?\n",
